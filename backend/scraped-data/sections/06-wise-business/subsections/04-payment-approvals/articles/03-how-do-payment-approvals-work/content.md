# Payment Approvals  
## How do Payment Approvals work?  
Payment approvals help businesses control their payments on Wise. Approval rules are currently only available if you have Wise currency accounts. Check which countries you can get Wise currency accounts in.

You can enable Payment approvals in two ways:

  1. Set up an approval rule

  2. Add a team member to your account as a **Preparer**




Payments that need approval will require **one Admin** to approve it. If a payment that requires approval is set up, eligible Admins will be automatically notified to review it. Once approved, the payment can then be funded and sent out. 

**Keep in mind:** Admins canâ€™t approve their own payments. Another Admin will need to approve it. 

Transfers that have been set up and are awaiting approval will appear under the **Needs your attention** section on the top of the Home page. After a transfer is approved/ rejected, it will appear amongst your other transfers in the Activity feed. 

Please ensure you have **Transfers and balances** notifications turned on to receive approval-related notifications.
