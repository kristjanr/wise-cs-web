# Wise Business basics  
## How do I send money as a business?  
If you wish to make transfers on behalf of a company, you’ll need to set up a Wise Business account with us.

To open an account, provide details about your business and the person who will manage the account. And depending on the amount of money you wish to send and where, we will need to verify your account before sending any money or opening a balance.

Learn more about verification and what details we’ll need

Please note:

  * When you are sending money on behalf of your business, the money must come from your business bank account. This must be the same as the name of the business registered with us.

  * If you have sent us money for a transfer from a business bank account but the transfer has been set up as a personal transfer (or vice versa), please let us know.

  * If you own or wish to make payments on behalf of 2 or more businesses, please get in touch and we can help set this up.

  * If your business ever becomes incorporated, or changes its entity type, you’ll need to be re-verified and provide proof of the change.
