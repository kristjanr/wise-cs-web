### What's the Wise API?

API helps you connect your business with Wise to automate your interaction with us. With API you wonâ€™t even need to log in to Wise to set up transfers - instead, all this and more can be automated. This allows you to significantly improve your (and your recipients') experience. Also, our API is free to use.

Banks like N26, Monzo, LHV, Aspire, Shinhan (along with 20+ other banks in Americas, Europe and APAC) and businesses such as Xero, GoCardless, Deel, Remote, Emburse, Preply, Gameflip, Bolt and many more are using our API to streamline their cross-border payments.
