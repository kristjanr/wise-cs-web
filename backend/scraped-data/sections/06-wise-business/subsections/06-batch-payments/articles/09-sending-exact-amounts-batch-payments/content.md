# Batch payments  
## Sending exact amounts ─ Batch payments  
If you need to make sure your recipient gets a certain amount of money in their home currency, you can simply do when you’re filling out the **“Send to bank accounts” template.**

  * On the template creation screen, click on **“Source currency”** and change it to **"Target currency"**. You can find this under the “Amount currency” section. 

  * You’ll see that the field next to it, **“Transfer amount”** is then updated to the recipient’s currency (with a country flag). 

  * Simply **type in the amount** you’d like for the recipient to get and we’ll calculate how much you’d need to send us in your currency.




 **Keep in mind:** if you select “source” as the “Amount currency”, we’ll deduct the fees first from your payment and send the rest to the recipient in their currency.

When using other templates (“Send by email” and “Send to saved recipients”) you can also specify either source or target currency under the “Amount currency” header.
