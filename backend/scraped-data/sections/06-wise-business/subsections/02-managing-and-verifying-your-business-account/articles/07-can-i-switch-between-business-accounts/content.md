# Managing and verifying your business account  
## Can I switch between business accounts?  
If you’ve got a business account set up — or you have access to several business accounts — it’s easy to switch between them. Please always make sure to check which account you’re using before creating a transfer.

 **Website**

  1. On the website, click on your name / your business name in the top right corner

  2. You will see your other accounts in the dropdown

  3. Select the account you'd like to switch to — other business or personal




 **Mobile app (iOS/Android)**

You can switch accounts on the mobile app via the **Your account** tab. 

  1. Click on the circle with your profile photo/initials in the top left corner. 

  2. You will see all your Wise accounts under **Other accounts.**

  3. Select the account you'd like to switch to — other business or personal




### What if I can’t see the account I’m looking for?

If you can’t see the account you’re looking for when you go to switch, it might be because:

  * You signed up with a different email address for that account. Try logging out, and then logging in again with the right email address. 

  * Your access may have been revoked. Contact an Admin or Owner to get access again.
