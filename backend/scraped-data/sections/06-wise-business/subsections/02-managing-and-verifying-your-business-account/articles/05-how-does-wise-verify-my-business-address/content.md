# Managing and verifying your business account  
## How does Wise verify my business address?  
If your business is already verified and you need to change its address, we might ask you to upload a copy of a document confirming your business address.

Please make sure the document shows:

  * your business name

  * your full business address

  * a date of issue

  * a logo, or clear name of the sender (a bank, a local authority, a utilities provider)

  * the nature of the document (type of bill, subject of the letter)




The business name and address on the document must match those on your Wise account.

For a registered business, we are only able to accept proof from an official business register showing the new address. This can be submitted either through a screenshot of the register, downloaded registry confirmation or a photo of a printed copy.

For Sole traders, a valid document can be:

  * a utility bill — gas, electricity, phone (we can’t accept mobile phone bills)

  * a bank or credit card statement (you must send a photo/scan of a physical letter or PDF copy of your statement)

  * a tax bill, or a tax notification

  * other government or financial institution-issued document




You can upload your document securely here.

Important information to note:

  * a utility bill, bank statement, council tax bill **can’t be older than 3 months**

  * you can also submit a document from a **local authority or FCA-authorised institution** which was issued **within the last 12 months**. For example, a yearly tax bill or a letter confirming the opening of a bank account

  *  **the business address can’t be a PO Box**

  * if you wish to change the **country** of your business, we will ask you to set up a new profile for your business




If your business address is already verified, and you need to change your personal address, that’s no problem. Learn how to change your address
