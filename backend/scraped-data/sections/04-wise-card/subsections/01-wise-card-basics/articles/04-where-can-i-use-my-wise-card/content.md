# Wise card basics  
## Where can I use my Wise card?  
Generally, you can pay with your Wise card in most places where debit cards are accepted. But, if you’re planning on taking your card abroad, check the lists below for countries where you won’t be able to use it. 

**Your card won’t work in these countries:**

Afghanistan, Belarus, Burundi, Central African Republic, Chad, Congo and The Democratic Republic of the Congo, Cuba, Eritrea, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Myanmar, North Korea, Russia, Somalia, Sudan and South Sudan, Syria, Venezuela, and Yemen.

 **If your card was issued in the US and you're a personal customer, it won’t work in these countries:**

Afghanistan, Belarus, Bolivia, Burundi, Cambodia, Central African Republic, Chad, Congo and The Democratic Republic of the Congo, Cote d’Ivoire, Cuba, People Republic of Korea, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Iran, Iraq, Kenya, Lebanon, Libya, Myanmar, Nepal, Niger, Nigeria, Pakistan, Paraguay, Sao Tome and Principe, Somalia, South Sudan, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Syria, Tajikistan, Tanzania, Turkmenistan, Uganda, Venezuela, Vietnam, Yemen.

 **If your card was issued in Malaysia,** it won’t work in Israel or for purchasing in ILS.

### Online payments

You can use your Wise card to make online payments, too. For some online payments, you’ll be asked to approve the payment from your Wise app, or using a code sent by SMS or call. This is called a 3D Secure (3DS) online payment and is an added level of security some websites ask for. Once you approve, your payment will go through as normal.

At the moment, we don’t support 3DS payments for cards issued in the US.

Some websites only accept locally issued cards. So if your online payment gets declined, that might be why.

### Cash withdrawals

You can also withdraw cash from most ATMs — except the countries specified above for US and non-US cards respectively. If you don’t know of any ATM near you, just use the Mastercard ATM locator or Visa ATM locator to find one.

If you got your debit card in Singapore or Canada, you can make payments around the world and withdraw from ATMs overseas. But, you can’t make ATM withdrawals in the country your card was issued.

If you got your debit card in Japan, you can make payments around the world and withdraw from ATMs overseas. You also **might** be able to use your card at these ATMs in Japan:

  * AEON

  * Family Mart

  * Daily Yamazaki
