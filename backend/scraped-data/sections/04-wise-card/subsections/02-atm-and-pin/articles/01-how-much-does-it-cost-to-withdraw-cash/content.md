## How much does it cost to withdraw cash?  
You can use your Wise card like any other bank card to withdraw money at ATMs around the world. 

The fees you pay depend on where your card was issued — it’s usually the registered address on your Wise account. If you’re using a different currency, the sum will be equivalent to the currency your card was issued in.

If you withdraw cash in a currency you're not currently holding, we'll charge a conversion fee to convert it for you. If you have multiple cards on your account, the fees apply per account.

Keep in mind that these are fees Wise charges on your card. Some ATMs may charge additional fees over these. We have no way of predicting those charges, but they’re usually visible on the ATM before you agree to the withdrawal. 

If you change your registered address after moving to another country and order a new card, we’ll automatically update the cash withdrawal fees for all your cards — to reflect the fees that apply to your new country of residence. If you set up your Wise account before 2 March 2023, we'll do this update for you on 22 May 2023.

###  **What fees do I have to pay to Wise?**

You get 2 free withdrawals per calendar month. From the third withdrawal, we’ll charge you the fixed fee applicable in your region, regardless of how much money you've withdrawn that month.

You also get a free withdrawal allowance each calendar month. This is the amount you can take out without paying a variable rate. We’ll charge you a variable rate if you go over your free allowance, regardless of how many withdrawals you made that month. 

You can find these fees and rates on the below table. For more detailed information, _check out our pricing page._ Make sure you set the correct location in the top right corner of the page.

 **Examples**

> You live in the US and withdraw money 3 times a month, taking out 75 USD each time. Your first withdrawal is free. Your second withdrawal has no fixed fee, but it has a variable fee of 1 USD: 2% on the 50 USD that was over the free allowance. The third withdrawal has a 1.50 USD fixed fee + 1.50 USD variable fee (2% of the 75 USD that was over the free allowance) 

> You live in Germany and withdraw money 3 times a month, taking out 10 EUR each time. Your first two withdrawals are free. Your third withdrawal has a 0.50 EUR fixed fee, but no variable fee as it's still under the monthly 200 EUR free allowance. 

> You live in New Zealand and make one withdrawal of 450 NZD. You don't pay the fixed fee, since it's your only withdrawal this month. You pay 1.75 NZD variable fee. (1.75% of the 100 NZD that was over the free allowance)

### What if the ATM charges me a fee, or asks me to choose a currency?

ATMs may ask to convert your money for you. If you say yes to this option, they’ll often charge an unfair exchange rate. 

To avoid extra fees from the ATM, be sure to choose the local currency where the ATM is.
