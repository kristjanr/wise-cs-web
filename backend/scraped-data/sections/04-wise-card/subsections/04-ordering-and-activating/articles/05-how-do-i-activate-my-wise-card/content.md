# Ordering and activating  
## How do I activate my Wise card?  
For most customers, there is no separate activation step for your Wise card. If your card was issued in the US or Japan check the relevant sections below. 

To activate your card you just need to make your first payment using Chip and PIN. If the Chip and PIN payment gets declined, please use the card at an ATM for either:

  * Cash withdrawal

  * Balance enquiry




If you're trying to activate your card in **Canada** , you won’t be able to make a cash withdrawal at local ATMs. Please choose Balance Inquiry in order to activate your card. 

Balance Inquiry is not supported for cards issued in **Brazil**. Please try a Chip and PIN payment or cash withdrawal at an ATM instead. 

### Japan cardholders

If your card was issued in Japan after the 27th of March 2023, you can activate it by using the 6 digit PIN we give you with your card.

  1. Go to your Wise account

  2. Go to **Card**

  3. Choose **Activate Now**

  4. Enter the 6-digit code that’s on the letter your card came attached to.




If your card was issued in Japan before the 27th of March 2023, you can activate it by entering your 4 digit pin when you check your balance from the following 4 ATM providers, please remember to choose "international cards" if prompted on the ATM:
