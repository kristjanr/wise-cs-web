Learn how to speed up your card order

If you haven’t received your card after the date shown, here are some things you can do

### Double check the address

You can see the address next to the delivery estimate. Please check to make sure it’s right. If it’s not, you can first try to change your delivery address. If you can’t change your delivery address, get in touch with us so we can help you order a new card.

### Wait a little longer

The delivery date you see in your Wise account is the best estimate we can give you. But sometimes it can take a little longer to arrive. Please wait a couple of extra days.

### Order a new card

If you’ve already waited past our delivery estimate and the card hasn’t arrived, you can order a new one. Once you’ve ordered a new card, we’ll cancel the first one, so you won’t be able to use it if it arrives. To order a new card:

  1. Log in to your Wise account

  2. Open the **Cards** tab on the website, or the **Card** tab in the app

  3. Open the delivery information

  4. Select **Card didn’t arrive? Order a new one**

  5.  **Confirm** to cancel the old card

  6. Select **Continue** to place a new card order
