# Ordering and activating  
## How can I change the name on my Wise card?  
### Before you complete your card order

 **Personal cards**

When you order your card, we'll show you a list of suggestions based on the name on your Wise account that you can choose from.

Please note:

  * Your card needs to have the first name and last name that closely match your Wise account

  * If your name is longer than 22 characters (including spaces), parts of it will be abbreviated with initials, or removed

  * If there are any characters that we can’t print on the card, we’ll automatically convert them to their Latin equivalent




 **Business cards**

The same name rules from personal cards apply to business cards. But the card will have a different design than the personal card and will have **business** written on it. If it’s longer than 22 characters (including spaces), it won’t be printed on the card. 

### After you complete your order

Once your card order is completed, you won’t be able to change the name on your card.
