## Can I speed up my card order?  
**If you ordered your card in the UK, EEA, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Malaysia or Japan** — you can speed up your first-time or replacement card(s) order.

 **If you ordered your card in the Singapore** — you can speed up the card order if the delivery address is outside Singapore. 

**If you ordered your card in the US** — you don’t have the option to speed up your card order. 

To receive your card faster you have to request the **expedited delivery method** when you request the card. **Once the order is placed it's not possible to expedite it**.

Typically your card can arrive anywhere between 3 working days to 3 weeks, depending on where you live. _Check how long delivery usually takes_. 

### How does the expedited delivery work?

Expedited delivery is done by DHL. Once the card has been produced, they’ll deliver it to you in person within 2 working days.

If you’re not at the delivery address to collect your card, they’ll try again one more time. If you’re not around to collect your card on the second try though, DHL will send the card back to us and we’ll destroy it. We can’t offer a refund for the cost of delivery in this case. 

**How much does it cost?**

It depends where your card is being sent to. We’ll show you the additional fee for this when you’re ordering. 

**Will I get a tracking number?**

Yes, you’ll get a tracking number by email if you choose to speed up your card order. And you can track your card on DHL’s website. 

Remember to add your contact information on DHL’s website to be notified about the delivery. 

### Can I change my delivery address or schedule it?

No, we can’t change your delivery address once you’ve placed a card order. Please cancel your card order and place a new one.
