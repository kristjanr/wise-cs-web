### Before you report an issue

If you notice a payment in your activity that you didn’t make, it may not be fraud. It could be a pending or delayed payment, that may take a little longer to finalise. If you don’t recognise a transaction, first check if it could be one of these things:

  *  **Pending payments from petrol/gas stations.** Petrol stations often preauthorise a maximum or estimated amount. The amount you actually spent should be charged in 1–3 days, and the rest will be automatically refunded to your account

  *  **Payments made offline.** Transactions made during a flight, or at a subway station or vending machine, are often delayed, so may appear in your activity when you’re not expecting them.

  *  **Unfamiliar business names.** Transactions are sometimes listed under a different trading name to the business you’re familiar with. Google the name to see if you recognise it.

  *  **Unexpected small charges.** Businesses might charge your card for a small amount to make sure it works. This is common for hotels and car rentals. These small charges will usually be refunded within a few days.

  *  **Subscriptions.** Free trials can lead to unexpected subscription charges. If this happens, get in touch with the merchant to ask for a refund, or cancel the subscription. Click here to learn more about unexpected subscription charges.




### How to report an issue

If you’ve checked the above cases and are sure they don’t apply to your transaction, the first step is to get in touch with the merchant. See if you can solve the problem together.

If you can’t, then you can report an issue using the link below. For all issues, we’ll need the following information:

  * a description of what happened and what you purchased in as much detail as possible

  * any proof you have, such as receipts and invoices, and links to websites for online purchases

  * copies of all communication between you and the merchant
