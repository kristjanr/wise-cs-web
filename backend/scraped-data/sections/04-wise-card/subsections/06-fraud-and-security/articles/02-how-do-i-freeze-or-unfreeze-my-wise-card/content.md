## How do I freeze or unfreeze my Wise card?  
If you lost your card, don’t recognise a transaction or just don’t want to use it for a while — freeze it to keep your money safe.

While your card is frozen, you won’t be able to use it to make any transactions. Once you’re ready to use your card again, you can defrost it by following the same steps. 

On the app:

  1. Open the Wise app

  2. Tap on **Card**

  3. Select **Freeze card**




On the website:

  1. Log in to your Wise account

  2. Select **Cards**

  3. Select **Freeze card**




When you’re ready to use your card again, follow the same steps and select **Defrost card**.
