### What if I haven’t received my money?

If you haven’t got the money within the timeframe specified for your currency, first check with the sender whether they used the correct account details.

If you’d like us to take a look, please send us a proof of payment so we can check it. This can be a receipt, bank statement, or a screenshot from an online bank showing:

  * sender’s name and account details

  * your name and account details

  * date they sent the money

  * amount they sent




We need to see all the above information in the one screenshot or document to be able to look into your problem.
