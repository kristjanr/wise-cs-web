# Receiving e-commerce payments  
## How do I receive money from Etsy with Wise?  
Etsy is a marketplace platform where businesses and individuals can sell handmade products from around the world.

When creating your Etsy account, you’ll need to enter your Shop country (this is where you or your business is located) and your Shop currency (this is the currency you want to withdraw from Etsy). 

You can change the Listing currency (the currency that your products are listed as) but you can’t change your Shop currency after you’ve set up your account, so choose the currency that you think you’ll have the most of your sales — this will help you save on conversion fees.

Etsy operates in USD. So if you sell on the platform using a different currency than your Shop currency, Etsy will convert the money from the sale currency to your Shop currency using a conversion fee. _Learn more about Etsy’s conversion fee_

Since Etsy operates in USD, you should select USD as your Shop currency to save money on conversion fees when withdrawing money from Etsy to your Wise USD account. Then you can use Wise to _convert the money to your preferred currency_ and _withdraw to your local bank account_. 

### Setting up your USD account details on Etsy

  1. Make sure you have _USD account details_

  2. On the Etsy website or Sell on Etsy app, select **Shop Manager**

  3. Select **Finances** and **Payment settings**

  4. Next to bank details, select **Update**

  5. You might need to confirm your bank information if you haven’t before

  6. Add your USD account details from Wise

  7. Etsy might send you 1 or 2 microdeposits to your Wise USD account to verify your ownership of the account. This can take 3–7 days to arrive, and you’ll need to go to Etsy and confirm the amounts received by going to Finances > Payment account > Verify account.

  8. All set. Now you can get paid in USD from Etsy.
