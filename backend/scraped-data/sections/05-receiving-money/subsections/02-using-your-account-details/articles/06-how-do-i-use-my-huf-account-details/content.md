## How do I use my HUF account details?  
### What are HUF account details?

These are your very own account details to receive Hungarian forints (HUF) with zero fees.

The account number we give you works in the same way as any Hungarian bank account when you’re receiving money. Just share your account number to your friends, company or customers, and they can send you HUF from any Hungarian bank account.

### How to receive HUF

First, you’ll need to get HUF account details. 

Then, share your details to the person who wants to pay you. They can pay you by local bank transfer, but they can’t pay you using international wire (SWIFT). 

We'll always give you an estimate for how long your transfer will take when you set it up. 

  * Payments up to 10,000,000 HUF will typically arrive in a few seconds. 

  * Payments above 10,000,000 HUF may take a bit longer — usually within a few hours on working days, or on the next working day during weekends.




### Payments from outside of Hungary

You can’t receive payments from outside Hungary, or in currencies other than HUF.
