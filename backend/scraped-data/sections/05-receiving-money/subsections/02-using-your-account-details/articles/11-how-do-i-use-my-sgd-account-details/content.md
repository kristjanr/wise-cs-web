# Using your account details  
## How do I use my SGD account details?  
####  **What are SGD account details?**

These are your very own account details to receive Singapore dollars (SGD) with zero fees.

This isn’t a bank account, but the account number we give you works in the same way when receiving money. Share your account name and account number with your friends, company or customers, and they can send you SGD from any Singapore bank account. And no one pays fees.

Get your _SGD account details_ and share your details with the person who wants to pay you.

####  **Receiving SGD for my personal Wise account**

Receive money through FAST (Fast And Secure Transfers) as well as PayNow.

You won’t be able to receive using GIRO, MEPS, international wire, SWIFT, or by cash deposits.

Your SGD account details can only receive up to 200,000 SGD per transfer, but there’s no limit on how many transfers you can receive per day.

If your Wise account address is in Singapore, you can't hold more than the equivalent of 5,000 SGD in your personal Wise account. This is because we are regulated by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) under the Payment Services Act.
