# Managing your Direct Debits  
## Why did my Direct Debit fail?  
Your Direct Debit can fail for a number of reasons, most of the time we’ll be able to give you some information of what happened. You can find this by going to **Home** in your account and finding the failed transaction.

Here’s some of the reasons your Direct Debit might have failed:

 **We don’t offer Direct Debits for your currency**

Direct Debits are only available for AUD, CAD, EUR, GBP, and USD accounts.

 **There wasn’t enough money in your balances**

When your merchant tried to debit your balance, there wasn’t enough money to cover the payment. 

**You cancelled the Direct Debit**

When you cancel an upcoming Direct Debit, you stop the merchant from debiting any money from your account going forward. 

**Your merchant had trouble setting up your Direct Debit**

There’s a number of reasons your merchant can have trouble setting up your Direct Debit. When this happens, we can’t process it correctly and have to reject it. 

**Direct Debits aren’t allowed in your country**

You may have recently changed your address to a country where we don’t offer balances or Direct Debits. 

### What do I do next?

Anytime your Direct Debit fails, we recommend that you get in touch with your merchant to learn more and arrange another way to pay. 

To avoid a rejected debit fee from your merchant, make sure to get in touch with them beforehand. If you are charged a fee, we can’t reimburse you as we weren’t the ones to charge it.
