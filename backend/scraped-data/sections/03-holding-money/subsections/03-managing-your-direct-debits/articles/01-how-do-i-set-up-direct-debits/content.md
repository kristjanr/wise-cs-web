# Managing your Direct Debits  
## How do I set up Direct Debits?  
When you set up a Direct Debit, you give a company permission to take regular payments from your account. You might use Direct Debits to pay for a monthly subscription like the gym, or to pay your phone or energy bill.

### Find your Wise account details

To find these details in the app:

  1. Go to **Home**

  2. Tap the balance at the top of the screen — at the moment, you can only set up Direct Debits from the AUD, CAD, GBP, EUR, and USD accounts




To find these details on the Wise website:

  1. Go to **Manage**

  2. Choose which balance you want to send from — at the moment, you can only set up Direct Debits from the AUD, CAD, GBP, EUR, and USD accounts




USD account Direct Debits for non-US residents are currently only available if your account details have a routing number starting with "084". 

We don’t support EUR account Direct Debits made via the SEPA B2B direct debit scheme. 

### Give these account details to the company you want to pay

To set up a Direct Debit, just give your Wise account details to the company you want to pay. They might ask you to fill in a form in person or online, or ask you for your account details over the phone. 

Once you’ve given the company these details, it’ll take a day or two for them to set it up. Check with them that they’ll set it up electronically. We can only accept the form by mail for GBP Direct Debits. 

If you don’t hold the currency you need to pay, you can still set up the Direct Debit. We’ll automatically convert it for you from the balance that has the lowest possible conversion fee. 

We’ll send you an email once the payment is done. But if that hasn’t happened after a couple of days, get in touch with the company you want to pay.

It’s free to set up Direct Debit payments — unless you are paying from a different currency, when we charge our normal conversion fee. We don’t charge for rejected payments.
