# Managing your Direct Debits  
## How do I cancel a Direct Debit?  
To get to your Direct Debits on the website:

  * Go to **Manage**

  * Click on one of your balances

  * Click on **Direct Debits**




To get to your Direct Debits on the app:

  * Go to **Account**

  * Under **Account services** , tap on **Direct Debits**




### To cancel a Direct Debit:

  1. Go to your **Direct Debits**

  2. Choose the Direct Debit you want to cancel

  3. Select **Cancel Direct Debit**




Make sure to cancel at least 1 working day before your payment is due, otherwise the Direct Debit might still go through.

Cancelling a Direct Debit won’t cancel the contract or subscription you have with the company you were paying. So don’t forget to cancel with them, or give them different account details. If you don’t, you might still owe them money, and they might charge you an extra fee for not paying on time.
