## How can I convert money?  
To convert money:

  1. Go to **Home** and select which balance you’d like to convert from

  2. Click **Convert**

  3. Enter the amount you’d like to convert from and the currency you want to convert to — you’ll need to have already added a balance in that currency

  4. Review and confirm the conversion




Conversions usually happen within a few seconds and should be reflected in your account immediately.

### Conversion limits

There are limits to how many times you can convert money between balances each day. Personal users can convert money up to 30 times in 24 hours. Business users can convert money up to 50 times in 24 hours. BRL accounts have a 10,000 BRL limit per conversion (Local taxes might be applicable).
