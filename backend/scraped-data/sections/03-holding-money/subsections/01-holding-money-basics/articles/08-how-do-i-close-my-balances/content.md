# Holding money basics  
## How do I close my balances?  
To close your balances, you’ll need to remove each currency one by one. Before you can do that, you’ll need to make sure there’s no money in that balance. To withdraw money:

  1. Go to **Home** and select the balance you want to withdraw from

  2. Select **Send**

  3. Choose the bank account you want to send your money to

  4. When asked how much you’d like to send, choose **Send it all**

  5. Confirm the payment to empty your balance




Once all your balances are empty, you can close them one by one.

  1. Go to **Home** and select the balance you want to remove

  2. Click on the three down ( **...** ) and then **Close balance**




### What if I have Direct Debits set up?

When you close a balance, any Direct Debits you have set up will automatically be cancelled. This won’t cancel the contract or subscription you have with the company you were paying. So don’t forget to cancel with them, or give them different bank details. If you don’t, you might still owe them money, and they might charge you an extra fee for not paying on time.
