# Using Assets  
## How do I use Assets?  
Right now, Assets is only available to some UK, Singapore and EEA residents and most businesses that are tax residents in the UK. If you see the option to change your Balance or Jar from Cash to Interest or Stocks, you're eligible. 

We’re working on expanding Assets it to more customers, and we’ll let you know when we’re done.

With Assets, you can decide how you'd like to hold the money in your Balances or Jars. Currently, you can choose Cash, Interest or Stocks.

### How do I switch between Assets?

By default, all of the money in your Balances and Jars is held as Cash. You can switch them back and forth between Stocks, Interest and Cash any time you want.

To change how we hold your money:

  1. Go to the Balance or Jar you want to change

  2. Select the **Cash, Stocks** or **Interest** icon




If you change how your money is held in a Balance or Jar, the icon will show as **Pending** while we make the change. This can take up to 2 working days — but it can take an extra working day if you’ve still got transactions in progress, or if we’re still processing a change.

### What happens if I select **Cash**?

Your Balances and Jars are held as Cash, by default. 

This means you can’t grow your money, but it isn’t at risk in the market. When you hold your money as Cash, it’s covered by our safeguarding policy.

### What happens if I select **Stocks**?

This means we’ll invest all of your money in the Jar or Balance in the index tracking fund we’ve chosen.

###  **What happens if I select Interest?**

This means we’ll invest all of your money in the Jar or Balance in the interest-earning fund we’ve chosen depending on the currency.
