# Using Assets  
## Licences and regulators when holding money as different Assets  
The licence which you are subject to when holding Balances or Jars as different Assets will depend on:

  * the Asset you are currently **holding**

  * the **address** you had on your Wise account when you switched a Balance or Jar to an **Asset** other than Cash.




Accounts and Jars held as Cash are always subjected to our payments institution / e-money licences based on your current address.

Balances and Jars held as Stocks or Interest operate under our investment licences based on your address at the moment you switch to Stocks or Interest. 

_For example, if you have an address in the EU when you switch assets from Cash to Stocks, you will be engaging with TINV Europe AS, our authorised EU investment firm._
