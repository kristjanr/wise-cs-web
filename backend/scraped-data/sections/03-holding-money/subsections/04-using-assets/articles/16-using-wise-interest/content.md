###  **What happens when you switch to Interest?**

Your money is kept in a fund holding government-backed short-term loans. When those loans are repaid, they come with interest — which gets passed on to you. Because the fund’s assets are issued or guaranteed by the government, they are extremely low risk. These funds are specifically designed to preserve capital and keep your money stable. However, investments, even in a low-risk fund, are never guaranteed.

The fund tracks the interest rate offered by the central bank of the currency it's in. Unlike traditional bank accounts, your return will change soon after any central bank rate changes. We’ll update the value of your money every working day, so there’s no more waiting a month to get what’s yours.

###  **Understanding the risks**

When you switch to Interest, we hold your money in a Public Debt Money Market Fund. This type of fund is trusted by banks and large corporations to keep their money safe and accessible, while giving them a return.

The main risks that can cause the value of the fund to decrease are the government defaulting or interests rates dropping to 0% or lower. Government defaults are unlikely. This means that while your investment is not guaranteed, the risk is low.

###  **Access to your invested money**

Limits and timeframes for accessing your money will depend on your country of residency.
