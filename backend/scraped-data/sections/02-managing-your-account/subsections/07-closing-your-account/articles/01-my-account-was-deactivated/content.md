# Closing your account  
## My account was deactivated  
There are a number of reasons why we might need to close your Wise account. 

We can’t tell you the specific reason why we closed your account — it’s because of how we’re regulated. And Customer Support doesn’t have the ability to view the reasons why.

 **We can choose to close an account if we think:**

  * it’s a duplicate of another (you can only have one Wise account, unless we agree otherwise)

  * its security has been compromised

  * there are transactions on your account that we can’t complete




These are just examples, though. You can find more reasons in our Terms of Use, where we explain how we’re allowed to close accounts. 

Wise never takes deactivations lightly, and they are handled with utmost attention and consideration. We fully understand that the deactivation can cause inconvenience to you and we're committed to going through this transition as smoothly as possible.

### Pending payments

When we deactivate your account, we cancel all pending payments. After reviewing your account, we’ll work on returning any money that you’ve already sent, the way we received it.

Refund time depends on how you paid for your transfer:

  *  **by card:** 3–10 working days

  *  **by bank/wire transfer:** 2–3 working days

  *  **by bank debit/ACH:** up to 90 working days, while we carry out due diligence checks




### Remaining balances

If you still have money in your Wise Balances when we close your account, we’ll work on sending it back to your bank account. But first, we need to carry out due diligence checks. While we do that, your money and information will be safe and secure. 

To request the funds to be refunded back to you — submit a refund request.

###  **Balance statements**

After deactivation, you're not able to access your account information, however if you need balance statements for tax purposes or other reason, please contact our support here.

###  **What can I do next?**

If you’re not happy with our decision to close your account, you can appeal it. During the appeal, you may be asked for more information and bank account details outside of Wise (to an external bank account) where to refund your money from the balances. The time it takes to review your appeal may vary, but we'll do our best to inform you of the status and timeline.

Additionally, you have the right to ask for a review of your case by lodging a complaint. 

During a complaint review, we'll assess the quality of the service and support you have received. We can also assess if we've honoured our agreements with you, like the Customer Agreement.

A complaint review does not include or affect re-assessing deactivation, or speeding up refunds and any part of the due diligence process. These will be dealt with in the appeal process. 

Commonly, a complaint should be reviewed within 14 calendar days, but can take longer depending on where we offer our services to you.
