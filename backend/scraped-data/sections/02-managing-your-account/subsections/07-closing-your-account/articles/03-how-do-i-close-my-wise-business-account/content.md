# Closing your account  
## How do I close my Wise Business account?  
When you sign up for a Wise Business account, you may or may not have a personal account attached to it. You can close just the business account, or both the personal and business accounts.

In either scenario, there are a few things you can do before closing your account(s):

  * Withdraw all money left on the balances

  * Download your transfer receipts and balance statements

  * Disconnect from all accounting platforms (e.g. Xero)




After doing the above, get in touch with us to close your account(s).

Once your account is closed, you won't have access to any of the activity or account statements on it anymore.

 **To withdraw money:**

  1. Go to **Home**

  2. Click on any balance with money in it

  3. Click **Send**

  4. Choose the bank account you want to send the money to

  5. When asked how much youâ€™d like to send, choose **Send it all**

  6. Click **Confirm**
