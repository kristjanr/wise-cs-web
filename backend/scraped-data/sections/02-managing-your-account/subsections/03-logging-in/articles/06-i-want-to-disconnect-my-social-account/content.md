You are connected to Wise with a social account if you log in with Google, Facebook, or Apple ID. Once you disconnect your social account, you can’t reconnect again in the future. 

To disconnect your social account on the website:

  1. Log in to Wise

  2. Go to **Settings** in the top right-hand corner

  3. Click on **Connected accounts**

  4. Scroll to **Social** and select **Disconnect**

  5. Create a password. To make sure you can log back in next time, go to **Change password** in **Settings** and set a password




To disconnect your social account on the app:

  1. Log in to Wise

  2. Go to **Your account** by clicking on the circle in the top left

  3. Click on **Privacy & Security** and select **Social disconnect**

  4.  **Disconnect** your social account

  5. Create a password. To make sure you can log back in next time, go to **Change password** in **Settings** and set a password




If you’re disconnecting your Apple ID, and have chosen to hide your email address, you’ll need to change your email with Wise before logging out. You can do this in your settings.
