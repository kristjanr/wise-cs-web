## I didn't receive the 2-step verification code or notification  
If you’re not receiving the 2-step verification code via text or an app notification from us, here’s what to do.

### 2-step verification with the Wise app

If you’re not getting the app notification for 2-step verification, check that:

  * wifi or mobile/cellular data is turned on

  * you’re checking the app on a device you set as **trusted**

  * you don’t have power saver mode on

  * you’ve turned on notifications from Wise




If it’s still not working, click I’m not receiving approval requests. We’ll send you a code by text message instead.

###  **2-step verification by text message**

If you’re not getting the text, check that:

  * your device can receive texts 

  * you’re checking the right phone number. It should be the one registered to your Wise account 

  * you have phone signal




If it’s still not working:

  * turn mobile/cellular data off and on

  * turn your phone off and on

  * try a local carrier if you’re on international roaming

  * choose the voice call option

### 2-step verification by WhatsApp

If you’re not getting the app notification, or the text message, you can choose to receive the code by WhatsApp. Just make sure your WhatsApp number matches the primary number on your Wise account.
