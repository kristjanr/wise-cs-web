# Setting up and managing your account  
## What do I need to get my business verified?  
When you open a bank account, you usually need to provide documents to verify details about yourself and your business. Wise is no different.

Verification is how we keep your business’s money safe, and comply with the financial regulations in the countries we operate in. We also make sure your business meets our Acceptable Use Policy. And we do everything we can to make it quick, painless, and completely online.

###  Here’s how to verify your business

  1.  **Register.** It’s easy to sign up for your Wise Business account — check the fees for your region on our pricing page.

  2.  **Tell us about your business.** You’ll need to share details like your business registration, where you’re located, the industry you’re in, any online or social presence, and name, date of birth, country of residence for all stakeholders, and a document showing who owns or controls the company.

  3.  **Tell us about yourself.** As the owner of this account, we need your personal details to verify your identity. If you’re not a director of the company, you may need to include additional information to confirm that you're authorised to act on behalf of the business.

  4.  **Set up and pay for a transfer.** If you're opening account details, you'll need to pay a one-time set-up fee. 

  5. **Now it’s our turn.** We'll let you know if we need extra information to verify you once we receive your money. This usually takes less than 10 working days. Keep in mind that if you added team members to your business account, they need to be verified, too.

  6.  **That’s it! You’re verified.** We’ll resume your transfer, and send you a confirmation email when we verify your business.
