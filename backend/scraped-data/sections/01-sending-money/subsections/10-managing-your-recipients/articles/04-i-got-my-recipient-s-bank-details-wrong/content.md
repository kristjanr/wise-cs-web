# Managing your recipients  
## I got my recipient's bank details wrong  
Everyone makes mistakes. And the fastest way to fix this one is by cancelling the transfer yourself. You can then set up a new transfer using the correct bank details.

Whether or not you can cancel depends on how far along your transfer is in our system. So before you get started, check the status of your transfer.

  1. Log in to your Wise account

  2. Go to **Home** to see your activity list

  3. Find the transfer in question — it should be marked as pending




 **You can cancel your transfer if: your transfer’s set up, your money’s on its way to us, or your money’s being processed.**

You should still be able to cancel your transfer at these stages. We’ll send the money back to you, and you can set up another transfer using the correct bank details.

 **Contact your recipient if you don’t see the cancel button, or your transfer’s complete.**

Our conversion process is fast — and sometimes it’s too late to cancel. Once it’s marked as complete, the money is out of Wise’s system and into the banking system. So if you don’t see the option to cancel:

  * Get in touch with the person you’re paying

  * Tell them how you got their bank details wrong

  * Ask them to contact their bank and find out whether the money can still be delivered, or whether their bank will send it back to Wise




 **Tip:** If the bank sends your money back to us, we’ll get in touch with you via email. You can then choose to set up your transfer with the correct bank details, or cancel your transfer and get a refund.
