# Managing your recipients  
## How to sync your contacts to find friends on Wise  
You can find your friends on your Recipients tab, when sending money, or in your settings under Contacts on Wise. We’ll simply show you an option to **Sync your contacts** — that’s it! 

You can remain private from others finding you, and still have the convenience of sending money to your friends. Or you can let people find you.

For now, you can only **Sync your contacts** on your Wise app.

### What if I can’t find my friend?

If you can’t add someone to your Contacts list, check that:

  * the phone number on their Wise account is right, and they’ve verified it

  * the phone number on their Wise account matches what you have in your phone’s contacts

  * they have turned on letting people find them

  * they have at least one balance open — this can be in any currency




### Are there any restrictions?

Right now, you can send money to all currencies that Wise supports, except BRL.

You can’t send to business accounts at the moment.

### Can I stop people from finding me and sending me money?

This feature is automatically switched off, so if you don’t want people finding you using your phone number, you don’t have to do anything.

If you’ve used it before and don’t want to anymore, this is how to stop people finding you.
