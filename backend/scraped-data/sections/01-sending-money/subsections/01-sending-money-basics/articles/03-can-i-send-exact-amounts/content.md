# Sending money basics  
## Can I send exact amounts?  
When you’re sending money, enter the amount you want your recipient to get in the calculator. Then click the padlock icon, to make sure your recipient gets that exact amount.

When you do this, we’ll add an amount lock deposit of 3% of the amount you’ll send. If the exchange rate changes, we’ll use a bit of the 3% to make sure the exact amount arrives. We’ll refund anything we don’t use back to you. If you click the padlock, you won’t get a guaranteed rate. 

You can also just enter the amount you want your recipient to get without clicking the padlock. If your money reaches us within the guaranteed rate time, the amount is fixed anyway (and we don’t need that extra 3%).

We only offer the amount lock for transfers from GBP, EUR (for payments from mainland Europe), AUD, BGN, CHF, CZK, DKK, HKD, HUF, JPY, NOK, NZD, PLN, RON, SEK, and SGD.
