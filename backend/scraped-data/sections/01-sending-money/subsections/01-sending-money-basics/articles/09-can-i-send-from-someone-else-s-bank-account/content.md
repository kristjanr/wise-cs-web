# Sending money basics  
## Can I send from someone else's bank account?  
In most cases, no — the name on the bank account you’re sending from has to match the name on your Wise account. 

But there are two exceptions:

 **You can send money from joint bank accounts**

You can send money from a joint bank account as long as you’re named on the account, and that name matches the name on your Wise account.

 **Tip:** We’ll ask you to enter the name of the other bank account holder when you set up your transfer. This helps us identify that your money’s coming from a joint account. 

**You can send money from a business you represent using Wise Business**

You can send money from a business bank account on behalf of a business you represent. But you need to have a Wise Business account. The name on the business bank account you’re using has to match the business registered with Wise Business.

 **Tip:** Get started with Wise Business to send money from a business. 

**If someone else has already paid for a transfer using your Wise account, you’ll need to cancel the transfer**

Unfortunately, we won’t be able to process this money, so we’ll pause your transfer. Please cancel the transfer yourself, and we’ll refund the money back to the sender’s bank account.
