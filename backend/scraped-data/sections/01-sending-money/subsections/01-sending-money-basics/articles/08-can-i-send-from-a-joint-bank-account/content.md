# Sending money basics  
## Can I send from a joint bank account?  
Yes. As long as:

  * you’re one of the account holders

  * your name on the account matches the name on your Wise account. 




**Tip:** We’ll ask you to enter the name of the other bank account holder when you set up your transfer. This helps us identify that your money’s coming from a joint account.

 **Do I need to prove that a joint bank account is in my name?**

Ordinarily, no. But banks sometimes send us the names on joint accounts incorrectly. If this happens, we’ll email you and ask for a proof of joint account document. 

Your transfer will be paused until we’ve received and approved that document. We’ll normally check it within 2 working days of receiving it from you.

 **Tip:** A proof of joint account document is either a screenshot or PDF of your joint bank statement, clearly showing your name, the bank’s name, and the account number.
