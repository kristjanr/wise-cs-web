## Problems paying by card  
Debit and credit card payments can be unsuccessful for a number of reasons. If an error message appears on your screen after you try to pay, or if we confirm your payment has not been successful, then you have not been charged.

### Payment declined by your bank

The most common reason for an unsuccessful card payment is that your bank has declined it. This means they’ve told Wise not to take the money. 

It’s normal for them to stop a payment that looks unusually large, or if it’s to a new and unknown recipient — just in case. 

The best way to fix this is to call your bank, let them know it’s you making this payment and that Wise is a trusted recipient. Once they’ve confirmed this, your next attempt should be successful.

### 3D Secure verification issue

Sometimes your internet browser can be what’s causing the problem with your 3D Secure verification. You can try following these browser solutions, and then make your payment again. 

If you’re still having issues with 3D Secure, call your bank to ask if there’s an issue, and to make sure your card is 3D Secure.

If the issue persists, try making a bank transfer to us instead, or use a different card if you can.

### Browser issues

Some anti-virus or firewall software can affect your card payment. To fix this, make sure Wise is on the list of "safe merchants" on your anti-virus software. Check that any anti-virus or firewall software you have installed allows pop-ups.

### Insufficient funds

Your bank might stop your card payment if there isn’t enough money in your account, or if you have a per-transaction limit. 

Though card limits vary from card to card and from bank to bank, limits in many southern European countries (France especially) can be as low as 300–500 EUR.

Other banks may treat card payments as cash withdrawals, meaning your cash withdrawal limit will apply.

To find out more or to adjust your limits, get in touch with your bank. It can take time for the changes to take effect, so try paying by bank transfer or setting up a smaller transfer in the meantime.

### Payment declined by Wise

Wise sometimes stops card payments to protect our customers from potentially fraudulent activity. It could be because your card was issued in a country we don’t currently support.

If this is the case, you’ll need to pay another way. Try paying by bank transfer or using a different card.

### Other

Most of the time, card payments are declined for the reasons listed above. But if you see a more generic error message, the best way to fix it is to try paying another way.
