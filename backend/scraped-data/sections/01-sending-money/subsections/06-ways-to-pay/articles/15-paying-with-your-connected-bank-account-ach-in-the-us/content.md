## Paying with your connected bank account (ACH) in the US  
When you pay with your connected bank account (ACH), you first need to _connect your preferred bank account_ and authorise a one-time debit from your account to our bank details. Then you need to choose your bank and authorise a payment each time you pay with this method. 

Here are some common questions about paying using your connected bank account (ACH) in the US.

### How long does it take for my money to reach Wise?

It usually takes up to 4 working days for your money to reach us. And you’ll usually see the debit in your bank account within 2–3 working days of making the transfer. 

Since it can take some time for the money to reach us, be sure you have enough money in your account while you wait for the debit.

###  **Guaranteed Rate with your connected bank account (ACH)**

When paying for a transfer or topping up your balance from your connected bank account (ACH), the guaranteed rate is secured once you have authorised the payment to Wise. With other payment methods generally the guaranteed rate is secured once Wise receives the money for your transfer.

### How much can I send? 

You can send up to 50,000 USD per 24 hours. You can also send up to 250,000 USD over a 60 day period on your personal account and up to 400,000 USD on your business account. 

### Do I need to give my Social Security number (SSN)?

Depending on a number of factors, we might ask for your SSN. But no one in Wise has access to it. 

If you don’t have an SSN, we’ll ask you why. You might be able to get verified with another form of US ID. But if you only have an ITIN, you have to use a non-US ID instead. 

### **What happens if I cancel my debit from the connected bank account (ACH)?**

You can cancel for a full refund, up to 30 minutes after you’ve paid — unless the money’s already been paid out. If the money has already left your bank account, please wait for our refund.
