## Types of transfers for sending EUR  
There are 3 types of transfers you can choose from to send EUR: Fast, Easy, and Low cost.

### Fast transfer

This type of transfer is the quickest way to send money abroad on Wise. It’s also faster to set up — you just need to type in your card details, or use your fingerprint with Apple Pay or Google Pay. But processing these transactions is more expensive.

Here’s why: firstly, with Fast transfers, your money isn’t sent to Wise instantly. As a result, Wise needs to do extra work to speed it up.

Secondly, when you use your card — or pay with Apple or Google Pay — you get extra support from Wise to keep your money safe if you’re unlucky enough to have your card used fraudulently.

All these things make Fast transfers more expensive. But Wise doesn’t make any more profit — it simply covers the extra costs associated with this type of transfer.

### Easy transfer

This type of transfer is a convenient and quick way to send 3,000 EUR or less. It’s available in Austria, Belgium, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland.

When you make an Easy transfer, you’ll use SOFORT to send the money. You won’t have to leave Wise to make a bank transfer. 

### Low cost transfer

This type of transfer is for customers who want the most from their money. 

For most people, these transfers are a bit less easy to make. They’re also slightly slower to fund, because you need to send the money to Wise as a separate transaction. 

You can do this using a manual bank transfer, or by using the money in your balances. You can also pay with iDeal, Trustly, or SOFORT when sending more than 3,000 EUR. Wise doesn’t need to do extra work to speed up how quickly your money moves. As a result, we can offer Low cost transfers at a much cheaper price.
