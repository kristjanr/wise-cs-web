# Ways to pay  
## Paying with online bill pay  
You can send Canadian dollars (CAD) with Wise via online bill pay. Sometimes it’s called bill payments, or OBT. It’s a cheap and convenient way to send CAD. 

An OBT can take 1-3 working days to arrive to Wise. 

Wise is listed as a bill payee with these banks and credit unions in Canada:

  * Bank of Montreal

  * National Bank of Canada

  * Central 1 Credit Unions*

  * EQ Bank

  * CS Alterna Bank

  * Manulife Bank of Canada

  * First Calgary Financial




Although the steps may vary from bank to bank, to send CAD with online bill pay is usually a similar process. You’ll need to set up your transfer, and choose Online bill pay as how you’d like to pay. Then, follow these steps.

  1. Log in to your online bank

  2. Go to the **Bill payments** section. It’s usually under transfers.

  3. Select **Make a payment**

  4. Select **Add a payee**

  5. Enter the following details about Wise:

    * payee province — ON (Ontario)

    * payee name — Wise or TransferWise. Some banks have not yet updated Wise's name in their systems. 

    * account number — your Wise membership number (starts with a P, no spaces or dashes)

  6. Select **Verify Payee**




That’s it! Once you’ve added Wise as a bill payee with your bank, you can easily use this payment method again.

*Many banks are a member of Central 1 Credit Union. If you’re able to add Wise as a bill payee, and your bank is not on this list, then your bank may be a part of Central 1 Credit Union. 

To send bill payments from Central 1 Credit Union (or any of its member banks), set the transfer up as a wire with us. Choose Wise as a bill payee in your online banking to send the bill payment — this way our system will be able to receive it.
