## Paying by SWIFT  
SWIFT payments, also called international wires, are a type of international transfer sent via the SWIFT international payment network. 

The SWIFT international payment network is one of the largest financial messaging systems in the world. Wise can send or receive certain currencies via SWIFT payment.

####  **Fees for SWIFT payments**

  * Your bank will likely charge a fee to make a SWIFT transfer to Wise. 

  * When the money is in transit, correspondent banks in between may also deduct their handling fees. Your bank should be able to advise what those would be.

  * If money is sent directly to your balance there’s nothing extra you need to do - we’ll deposit whatever we receive into your account.

  * Try to make sure your bank will cover any fees associated with the payment so that we can receive the full amount for your transfer. This is known as an "OUR" SWIFT transfer.




####  **Transfer times for SWIFT payments**

SWIFT payments usually take 2–5 working days to reach their destination, however it is possible that they can take longer due to time differences between the sending and receiving country, or multiple intermediary banks involved with delivering your money to us.

We pay out via SWIFT when you send USD to countries outside the US, GBP to countries outside the UK, or EUR to banks that are not part of SEPA and countries outside of SEPA.
