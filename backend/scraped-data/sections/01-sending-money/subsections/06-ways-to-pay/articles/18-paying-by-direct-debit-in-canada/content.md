## Paying by direct debit in Canada  
When you pay by direct debit, you enter your bank information and authorise a one-time debit from your checking account to ours. You need to do this each time you pay by direct debit. 

Direct debit in Canada is also known as an EFT (Electronic Funds Transfer) payment.

Here are some common questions about paying by direct debit from Canada. 

### How long does it take for my money to reach Wise?

It usually takes 1–2 working days for the money to leave your account, and then 3–4 working days for it to reach us.

Since it can take some time for the money to reach us, be sure you have enough money in your account while you wait for the debit. 

### How much can I send? 

You can send up to 9,500 CAD every 24 hours, and up to 30,000 CAD every week.

###  **Guaranteed Rate with Direct Debit**

When paying for a transfer with direct debit, the guaranteed rate is secured **once you have authorized the payment to Wise**. For other payment methods, the guaranteed rate is secured once Wise receives the money for your transfer.
