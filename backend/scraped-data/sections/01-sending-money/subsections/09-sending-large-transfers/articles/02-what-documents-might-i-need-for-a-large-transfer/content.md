# Sending large transfers  
## What documents might I need for a large transfer?  
When you send a large amount with Wise, we need to verify your account as usual.

But, depending on how much you send, we might also need to check how you got the money for this transfer. And we might ask to see some documents as proof.

It’s a good idea to have your documents to hand before you start. This will help to speed up the process if we do ask to see them.

 **What documents might I need?**

This article lists examples of documents we might ask for, depending on whether you’re sending from a personal account or a business account.

 **What do my documents need to show?**

Your documents need to show your full name, the total amount (which should cover the amount you’re sending), and the date you received the money.

Depending on how you got the money, your documents might need to show some other information too. Read the rest of this article to find out more.

 **How many documents should I provide?**

If we ask to see proof of where your money came from, it’s best to provide as many of the documents we’ve listed as you can. We might contact you if we need more information.

 **Will a bank statement do?**

It’s always best to provide other documents as well. Bank statements can help us to verify where your money came from, but they’re usually not enough on their own.

 **Do I need to send documents in advance?**

There’s no need to send documents in advance, because we can’t check them before you set up a transfer.

 **Do I need to get my documents translated?**

You don’t need to get your documents translated. You can send them to us in the original language.
