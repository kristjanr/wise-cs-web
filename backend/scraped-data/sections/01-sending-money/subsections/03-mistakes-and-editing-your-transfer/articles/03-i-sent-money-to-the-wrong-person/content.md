# Mistakes and editing your transfer  
## I sent money to the wrong person  
Everyone makes mistakes. And there are 2 ways to fix this one:

  * depending on where the money is, you can cancel the transfer yourself and start again

  * if the money has reached your recipient, you’ll need to contact them and ask for the money back




 **So before you get started, check the status of your transfer.**

  1. Log in to your Wise account

  2. Go to **Home** to see your activity list

  3. Find the transfer in question — it should be marked as pending




 **You can cancel your transfer if you can see the cancel button on the transfer.**

We’ll send the money back to your bank account, and you can set up another transfer to the right person.

Learn how to cancel your transfer

 **Contact the recipient if you don’t see the cancel button, or your transfer’s complete.**

Our conversion process is fast — and sometimes it’s too late to cancel. Once it’s marked as complete, the money is out of Wise’s system and into the banking system. So if you don’t see the option to cancel:

  * get in touch with the recipient

  * tell them about the mistake

  * ask them to send the money back to you — you can then set up a new transfer if you need to




 **Tip:** If you can’t cancel your transfer on Wise, it’s out of our system — so we can’t cancel it either. So please get in touch with your recipient directly.
