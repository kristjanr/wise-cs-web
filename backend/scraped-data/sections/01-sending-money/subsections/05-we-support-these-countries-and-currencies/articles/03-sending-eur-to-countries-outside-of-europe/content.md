# We support these countries and currencies  
## Sending EUR to countries outside of Europe  
With Wise, you can send euros (EUR) to bank accounts in countries outside of SEPA. 

We send EUR to bank accounts outside of SEPA using the SWIFT payment network. It’s different than a regular Wise transfer so will take a bit longer to reach the recipient. 

## How it works

  1.  **Set up your transfer on Wise.** You’ll need to add a new recipient to get started. 

  2. **Add your recipient’s account details.**

  3.  **Pay for your transfer.** We’ll send the EUR to your recipient as usual. 




## How much it costs

 **Your fee:** It costs us extra to send money by SWIFT, so we’ll add that amount to the regular Wise fee.

For the most up to date pricing information, please review the Terms of Use for your region. 

**Your recipient’s fee:** Your recipient’s bank may charge fees to receive payments sent with SWIFT. In addition, the recipient might be charged by any banks that handle the money along the way. We don’t have control over when these fees are charged, or how much they cost.
