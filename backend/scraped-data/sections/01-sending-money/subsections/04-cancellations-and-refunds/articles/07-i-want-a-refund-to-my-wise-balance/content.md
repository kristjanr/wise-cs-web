# Cancellations and refunds  
## I want a refund to my Wise balance  
Wise refunds your money to the account you paid with. 

This means we’ll only refund money to your balance if you used it to pay for your transfer. If you sent money from your bank account, we’ll refund your money back to your bank account. 

**Tip:** Learn about using balances in your Wise account.
