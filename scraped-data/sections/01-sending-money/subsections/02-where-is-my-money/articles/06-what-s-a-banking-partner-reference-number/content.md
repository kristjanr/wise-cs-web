## What's a banking partner reference number?  
For every transfer you send with Wise, we give you a transfer number, which you can use if you need to get in touch with us.

For some transfers, we’ll also give you a banking partner reference number. It’s called this because we send out your money through local banking partners in each country.

### How do I use the banking partner reference number?

Give the banking partner reference number to your recipient. They can use the banking partner reference number to see where the transfer is once it’s shown as completed on your Wise account.

The recipient will need to give this number to the recipient’s bank if they get in touch with them.

In different countries, banks might call it something else. For example, in India, banks sometimes call it a UTR (Unique Transaction Reference) number, or a transaction reference number.
