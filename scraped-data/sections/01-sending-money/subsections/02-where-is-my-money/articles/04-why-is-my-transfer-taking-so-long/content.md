# Where is my money?  
## Why is my transfer taking so long?  
We’ll always tell you upfront when your money should arrive. And once your transfer’s on its way, we’ll send you updates via email. 

Track your transfer

Here are some reasons why your transfer might be delayed — and how you can speed things up.

 **You might have chosen a slower way to send us the money**

You can select from different kinds of payment methods to pay for your transfer. Some are faster than others, so you can speed your transfer up. For example, if you pay by card, we can start your transfer straight away. But if you make a SWIFT transfer, we’ll need to wait until we receive your money — and that could take 2–5 working days.

 **Tip:** We’ll always show you how long each payment method takes to arrive to us — pick a faster one if time is of the essence. 

**Weekends and holidays might slow things down**

Once we’ve received your money, we convert it to the new currency and send it out. This is the quickest part. But banking hours, weekends, and public holidays are out of our control — so this might slow down the process.

 **Tip** : If your transfer’s urgent, plan around weekends and public holidays.

 **The receiving bank might take extra time to process it**

After we send your money out to your recipient’s bank, they’ll process and clear the money. But some banks are faster than others — it might take up to 2 working days for some currencies. At this point, the money’s out of our system, but the bank should be able to help.

 **Tip:** Your recipient can ask the receiving bank to clear the money faster. Just share the transfer receipt with their bank.

We’re trying to identify the banks that are slower, so we can give you a more accurate estimate. If you’d like to help, you can let us know when the money arrived.
