# Managing your recipients  
## How do I add or delete recipients?  
Whenever you send money to someone, we’ll save their recipient details automatically. But you can also add their details ahead of time. You can also delete them if they’re no longer needed.

### How to add a new recipient

  1. Go to **Recipients**

  2. If you’re adding your own account, select **Add your bank account**. If you’re adding someone else’s account, select **Add a recipient** — Find your friend using their email address to make this easier, or simply fill in their details.

  3. Select **Confirm** to save your recipient




Once you’ve saved a recipient, you can’t edit them. If you need to make a change to their information, you’ll need to delete them as a recipient and add them again. 

The **Recipients** tab doesn't show you all of your recipient's details. If you're not sure if their details are correct, you can delete the recipient and add them again. 

### How to delete a recipient

  1. Go to **Recipients**

  2. Select the recipient details you want to remove

  3. Select **Delete recipient**
