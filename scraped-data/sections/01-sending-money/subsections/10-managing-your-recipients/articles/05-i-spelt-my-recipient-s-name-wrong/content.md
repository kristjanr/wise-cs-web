# Managing your recipients  
## I spelt my recipient's name wrong  
Everyone makes mistakes. And the fastest way to fix this one is by cancelling the transfer yourself. You can then set up a new transfer using the correct name.

Whether or not you can cancel depends on how far along your transfer is in our system. So before you get started, check the status of your transfer.

  1. Log in to your Wise account

  2. Go to **Home** to see your activity list

  3. Find the transfer in question — it should be marked as pending




 **You can cancel if your transfer’s set up, your money’s on its way to us, or your money’s being processed.**

You should still be able to cancel your transfer at these stages. We’ll send the money back to your bank account, and you can set up another transfer using the correct name.

 **Contact your recipient if you don’t see the cancel button, or your transfer’s complete.**

Our conversion process is fast — and sometimes it’s too late to cancel. Once it’s marked as complete, your transfer is out of Wise’s system and into the banking system. This means we can’t make any changes to it.

So if you don’t see the option to cancel:

  * Get in touch with the person you’re paying

  * Tell them that you got their name wrong

  * Ask them to contact their bank and find out whether the money can still be delivered, or whether their bank will send it back to Wise




 **Tip:** If the bank sends your money back to us, we’ll get in touch with you via email. You can then choose to set up your transfer with the correct name, or cancel your transfer and get a refund.

### If the recipient’s bank asks for a name amendment letter

In rare cases, your recipient’s bank will ask Wise for a name amendment letter. Unfortunately, we can’t provide these. If that happens:

  * Get in touch with the person you’re paying

  * Ask them to contact their bank and tell them to reject the payment

  * Their bank will then send the money back to Wise




Once we’ve received the money from the bank, we’ll get in touch with you via email. You can then choose to set up your transfer with the correct name, or cancel your transfer and get a refund.
