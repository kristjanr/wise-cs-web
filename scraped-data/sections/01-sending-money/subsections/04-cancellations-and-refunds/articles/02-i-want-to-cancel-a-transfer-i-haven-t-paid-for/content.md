# Cancellations and refunds  
## I want to cancel a transfer I haven't paid for  
Depending on what step your transfer is at, you may be able to cancel it. First, check the status of your transfer in your activity list. Then, match the status to the corresponding step below to see what you can do.

### You set up your transfer

You can cancel your transfer yourself at this step. 

  1. Go to **Home** to see your activity list

  2. Find the pending transfer you want to cancel

  3. Click **Cancel transfer** (on Android, you’ll find this by clicking the 3 dots at the top right corner of the transfer page)

  4. If you haven’t paid yet, click **I didn’t pay** , and then **Cancel transfer**

  5. If you’ve already paid, click **I paid** , and enter your bank account details if needed




Find out why you need to enter your bank account details. 

You won’t need to give us your bank account details if you paid for your transfer by credit or debit card. In this case, we’ll automatically refund the transfer to the card you paid with, and won’t ask for more information. 

### Your money’s on its way to us

You can still cancel your transfer yourself at this step. Just follow the directions above to do so. You may also see a different message for the this step, like “Your money may still be in your bank account”, or “Sorry, we didn’t get the money yet”. This is fine, you’ll still be able to see the Cancel transfer button underneath the transfer. If you cancel at this point, it can still take a few business days for the money to be refunded into your account, as it has to arrive at Wise before we can refund it.

### Your money’s being processed

At this point, your money is with us for conversion. You may be able to cancel the transfer by yourself if you can still see the Cancel transfer button. But, if you can’t see it, you’ll need to get in touch so we can cancel it. Our conversion process can be fast, so make sure to reach out as soon as possible. If we haven’t sent out the money yet, we can refund it back to you. 

### Your money’s been sent out

Once Wise sends out the money, unfortunately there’s nothing we can do to refund it. If the recipient’s details are wrong, their bank will usually reject it and send the money back to us. We’ll get in touch with you if this happens to ask whether you’d like to update the details and send it again, or cancel the transfer and get a refund. 

If you’ve made a mistake in the amount you sent, or you don’t want to send the transfer anymore, your recipient will need to contact their bank and ask them to reject the payment. This means the money will be sent back to Wise, and we’ll refund it back to you.

### Your transfer’s complete

Once a transfer has been sent to the recipient’s account and is marked as complete, we can’t cancel it.

We recommend you get in touch with the recipient and ask them to return the money to you, or, if the payment was to yourself, transfer it back. 

Unfortunately, Wise can’t get involved in disputes between senders and recipients, so we recommend you know and trust the person or business you’re sending to before you make a transfer.
