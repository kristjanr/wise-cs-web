# Cancellations and refunds  
## How long do refunds take?  
The time it takes for a refund to get paid back into your account depends on a number of things. These include the way you paid for the transfer, the currency you paid with, and how long your bank takes to process refunds. 

### Refunds for bank transfers

Generally, a bank transfer takes between 0â€“3 working days to appear back in your account. For more specific times based on your currency and payment method, find the currency you paid with. Refund information is at the bottom of each page. 

### Refunds to credit or debit card

If you paid by credit or debit card, the refund can usually take up to 10 working days to go back into your account. The reason it can take so long is because both our provider and the bank that issued your card need to process the refund. 

For specific times based on your currency, find the currency you paid with. Refund information is at the bottom of each page. 

### Refunds to other payment types

If you paid for your transfer another way, please find the currency you paid with. Refund information is at the bottom of each page.
