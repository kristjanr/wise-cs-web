# Cancellations and refunds  
## I want to cancel a transfer that's completed  
You can’t cancel a completed transfer. All transfers completed by Wise are final, and Wise can’t reverse or recall payments. Once your transfer is marked as completed on our website, we can’t cancel it.

Wise does not have the ability to be involved in disputes between senders and recipients, so we strongly recommend that you know and trust the person or business that you are sending to before setting up a transfer or sending any money. 

While we can’t get involved in disputes, we try to do everything we can to keep our customers safe. We’ll investigate any claims of fraud, and, if we find that someone has used Wise to receive money fraudulently, we’ll block them from receiving money through us.
