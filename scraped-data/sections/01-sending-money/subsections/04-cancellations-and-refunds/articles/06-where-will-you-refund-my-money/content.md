# Cancellations and refunds  
## Where will you refund my money?  
Wise automatically refunds your money to the bank account or card that you paid with.

The exception to this is if you’ve paid with your Wise balance. If you have, we’ll refund your money to the balance you paid with.

### Why is Wise asking me for refund account details?

For some currencies, the details of the bank account you paid with aren’t visible to Wise. In these cases, we’ll ask for your bank account details — it’s safe and secure to fill them in. And we can’t refund your money without them.

We might also ask for refund account details if you’ve accidentally sent us too much money. Or if there’s money left over after you’ve made an amount lock transfer.

 **Tip:** If you’ve paid from a bank account in Brazil, refunds work slightly differently. Learn more about refunds to Brazilian bank accounts.
