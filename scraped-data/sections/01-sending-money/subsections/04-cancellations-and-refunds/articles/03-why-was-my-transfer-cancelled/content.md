# Cancellations and refunds  
## Why was my transfer cancelled?  
Sometimes, Wise will cancel your transfer. There are a few reasons why we might do this — here are some of the most common ones.

### You didn’t pay for the transfer

If you set up a transfer and don’t pay for it within 2 weeks, we’ll automatically cancel it. If you’d still like to make that transfer, you can set up a new one.

You won’t get the same rate as the original transfer you set up. This is because we only guarantee the rate for 24–48 hours, depending on the currency you send. So, if your transfer was cancelled for this reason, the original rate would have already expired.

### We need more information from you

For some transfers we might need more information from you. If we do, we’ll send you an email letting you know what we need. If we don’t hear from you in 2 working days, we’ll automatically cancel and refund your transfer. So, every time you send a transfer with us, please keep an eye on your emails.

### The recipient details are wrong

If you make a mistake in the recipient’s details, most banks won’t accept the payment. They’ll send the money back to us, and we’ll ask you whether you’d like to edit the details, or cancel the transfer. If we don’t hear from you in 2 working days, we’ll cancel and refund the transfer. And if you edit the details and the payment fails again, we’ll automatically cancel the transfer.

Please check your recipient’s details carefully every time you make a transfer. Here’s what to do if you made a mistake.

### You didn’t set up a transfer

Sometimes, people send us money without setting up a transfer first. This means we get your money, but don’t know where to send it. If this happens and you have a balance in the currency you send us, we’ll automatically add your money to that account. It’ll show on your activity list as “AutoCredit”.

If you don’t have a balance, we’ll refund your money and let you know by email. It’ll show on your transaction list as “AutoRefund”.
