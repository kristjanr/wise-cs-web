## What if I miss my guaranteed rate?  
If your money reaches us after your guaranteed rate lock has expired, we’ll use the live rate at the time we receive it. This means that if your rate lock expires at 2pm, and your money reaches our account at 4pm, we’ll lock the live rate at 4pm and use that to send your money.

For this reason, it’s usually best to get your money to us as soon as possible.

It’s common for banks to have limits on the amount you can send online, and this often leads to Wise customers missing their guaranteed rate. To make sure you always get the rate you’ve locked, read our tips on sending money with your bank.
