# Rates and fees  
## What's a guaranteed rate?  
A guaranteed rate is exactly what you’d expect: an exchange rate that’s guaranteed for a specified period of time. We offer guaranteed rates for all of our transfers. 

As you finish setting up your transfer, we’ll guarantee your rate for a certain period of time. It’s important that you send your money to us right away so we receive your money on time. As long as we receive your money on time, you’ll get that rate locked.

If your money doesn’t reach us in time, we’ll still convert and send it as soon as possible. But we’ll use the mid-market rate instead.

### How long is the rate guaranteed on my transfer?

We guarantee your rate long enough for your money to get to us. It depends on the currency you’re sending from. We’ll always tell you how long the rate is guaranteed for when you set your transfer up.

###  **What if the rate changes significantly in that time, or the rate is unstable?**

For any transfer with a guaranteed rate, there's a 5% rate limit. If the rate **changes by 5% or more** during the guaranteed rate period, we may cancel and refund your transfer. We’ll send the money back to the account it came from. 

Sometimes, markets can be volatile. This means we may need to set temporary limits on the amount of money you can send with the guaranteed rate, even if the movement is under 5%. You'll see a notification for this when trying to send over the limit.

When adding money to your balance from a different currency, just add the same currency first, and convert it to the one you want to send. This ensures we give you the best rate at the time.

### What if my transfer falls on a weekend?

In most countries, banks don’t process transfers over the weekend — they start paying them out on the following working day. Because of this, we usually don’t count the weekend when we calculate guaranteed rates. For example, if your transfer has a 48-hour guaranteed rate, and you set up your transfer on Friday, at 5:00pm, your rate will be guaranteed until Tuesday at 5:00 pm. 

If we do guarantee your rate over the weekend, you’ll see this when you set your transfer up. 

Note: weekends in some countries, such as the UAE, are Friday and Saturday. In this case, we’d send out your money on the Sunday.

### What rate do I get if I set up a transfer on the weekend?

Because the market closes on a Friday, we don’t give new rates over the weekend. So, if you set up a transfer on a weekend, you’ll get the last rate before the market closed on the Friday. 

We stop getting live rates at 5pm New York time, and we start getting live rates again at 9am Auckland time. 

### How many transfers can I set up with a guaranteed rate?

You can’t set up an unlimited number of transfers with a guaranteed rate. And you should only set up a transfer if you intend to complete it. We’ll limit the number of guaranteed rate transfers you can make if we notice you’re setting up multiple ones to get the best rate.

If you created multiple transfers but only paid for one of them, we’ll assign your deposit to the first transfer you created. You can cancel any transfer you don’t intend to complete and leave just one active, so we know where to assign your money to.

Keep in mind that if you remain at one step of the transfer setup process for more than 30 minutes, the guaranteed rate will refresh.

### What if the rate changes significantly?

When you create a transfer with a guaranteed rate, you’re subject to a rate limit of 5%. So if the rate changes by 5% or more during the time we guarantee your rate for, we reserve the right to cancel and refund your transfer. If that happens, we’ll send the money back to the account it came from. 

### What if I don’t pay by bank transfer?

If you chose a payment method other than bank transfer, your rate is locked when you’ve successfully paid.

If you paid for your transfer from USD using ACH bank debit, we’ll lock your rate when you confirm the payment on Wise.
