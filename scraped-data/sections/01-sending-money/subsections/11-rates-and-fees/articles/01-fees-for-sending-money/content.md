 **How we work out the cost of a transfer** How much a transfer costs depends on three things — the amount you’re sending, how you pay, and the exchange rate. 

**The amount you’re sending** The more money you send, the more your transfer costs. That’s because the Wise fee is worked out as a percentage of the amount you’re sending. The percentage varies from currency to currency, and you can check it on our pricing page. The exception to this is if you’re sending a small amount of money, in which case there’s a cheap, minimum fee. 

**How you pay** There are different ways to pay depending on the country you’re sending from. You’ll see how much each payment method or type of transfer costs when you set up your transfer.

 **The exchange rate** You always get the mid-market rate — it’s the one banks use to trade between themselves. Because we never mark this rate up, your recipient typically gets more money at the other end. 

The mid-market exchange rate is always moving. So for some of our currencies, you can lock in the rate you see when you set your transfer up — and you’re guaranteed to get it, as long as we receive the total amount in the stated timeframe (normally 24 or 48 hours).
