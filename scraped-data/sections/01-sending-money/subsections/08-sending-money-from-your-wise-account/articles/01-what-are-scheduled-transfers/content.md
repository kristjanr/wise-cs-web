# Sending money from your Wise account  
## What are scheduled transfers?  
Scheduled transfers are transfers you'd like to send out at a later date of your choice.

Anyone can set up a scheduled transfer. If you don’t hold a Wise balance in the currency you’re planning to send money from, we’ll open one for you. You’ll use this account to see your money coming into Wise, and being sent to your recipient. 

If you live in Singapore, you can only schedule transfers below 5,000 SGD and up to 30,000 SGD a year with your personal Wise account.

 **Quick tip:** if your transfer is time-sensitive, we recommend scheduling it at least 3 days in advance. Currently, you can only set up scheduled transfers on the website and Android mobile app. 

### How do I make a scheduled transfer? 

  1. Select **Send money**

  2. Confirm where you're sending from (your balance, or an external account)

  3. Enter the amount you’d like to send

  4. Select the calendar icon next to **Continue** to schedule your transfer

  5. Choose the date you’d like us to send your money

  6. Choose the frequency (one-time, monthly, bi-weekly, weekly)

  7. Select **Confirm**




We’ll remind you to make sure you have enough money in your balance, or bank account, for your transfer before your scheduled date.

 _Turn on notifications for updates about your transfer_

You can check the status, or cancel your scheduled transfer, by going to **Manage** and then **Scheduled Transfers** on the website, or by going to the **Manage** tab in your app.

###  **Can I edit a scheduled transfer?**

We can't change the details of a scheduled transfer. If you need to make changes, please cancel the transfer and set up a new one with the correct details.

### What happens to my transfer on the scheduled date?

 **If your transfer is scheduled for a holiday or non-working day**

It depends on the payment method you choose to pay with, and the country you're sending money to. For example:

  * For transfers from USD or CAD — if you’re paying by direct debit, we’ll schedule the payment on the next working day.

  * Most payments to GBP are instant, so we’ll instantly send the transfer the moment we’ve received your money. 




**If you schedule a monthly transfer on the 30th, and the upcoming month has less than 30 days**

Your transfer will be sent on the last day of that month. 

For example, if you schedule a monthly transfer on 30 January, but February only has 28 days — your transfer will be sent on the 28th.

 **If your scheduled transfer is sent directly from your balance**

The scheduled date of your transfer is the day we send the money to your recipient — not the day they receive it. 

Your recipient should get the money within 3 days from the scheduled date.

 **If your scheduled transfer is sent from your external bank account**

The scheduled date of your transfer is the day we pull money from your account — not the day your recipient receives it. 

It usually takes 1-4 working days for your money to reach us. You will see the debit in your bank account usually within 2-3 working days of making the transfer. 

### Does my recurring transfer ever end?

Your recurring transfer ends on the date you selected when you set it up. If you didn’t set up an end date, you can cancel future transfers in **Manage** under the **Schedule transfer** section, or in the app under the **Manage** tab.

 **When can I cancel my scheduled transfer?**

You can cancel your transfer up to 23:59 the day before your transfer is scheduled.

### Will I get a guaranteed rate?

The short answer is no, you won’t get a guaranteed rate. This is because you’re requesting that we send the money out later, and we can’t predict the future — as much as we wish we could.

We’ll send out your transfer on the morning of the scheduled date, using the current mid-market rate at the time.

 **How much money will my recipient get?**

When you set up your scheduled transfer, you can pay a fixed amount or set a fixed amount that your recipient will get.

If you pay a fixed amount, we’ll show you an estimate of what your recipient will get. But because the rate might be different on the day of your scheduled transfer, your recipient could receive more or less. 

When your transfer is sent, you can check how much your recipient received by going to **Scheduled Transfers** under **Manage** and selecting the transfer.

### My scheduled transfer failed

​​There are a few reasons why your transfer might fail. To avoid this, make sure to turn on your notifications so we can let you know if there’s a problem.

For scheduled transfers that recur, we’ll still try to send your transfer on the next scheduled date.

 **Insufficient funds**

There wasn’t enough money in your balance, or bank account, to pay for your scheduled transfer. You can set up a new transfer if you still want to send money.

 **We need more information from you**

We might need more information from you. If we do, we’ll send you an email letting you know what we need. 

If we don’t hear from you by the date your transfer is scheduled, your transfer will fail.

 **There’s something wrong with your recipient’s details**

Your recipient’s information was incorrect or invalid, so we couldn’t complete your transfer.

 **You’re paying by direct debit**

You might be having a _problem with your ACH bank debit in the US_, or a _problem with your direct debit in Canada_.
