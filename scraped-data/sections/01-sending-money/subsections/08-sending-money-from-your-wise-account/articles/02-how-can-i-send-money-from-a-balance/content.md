# Sending money from your Wise account  
## How can I send money from a balance?  
Sending money from your Wise balance is faster than sending from a bank account outside of Wise — and for transfers over 1,000 GBP or equivalent in other currencies, the fees are lower, too. 

Before you start, you’ll need to open a balance and make sure you have enough money there to make your transfer. Here’s how to add money.

There are 2 ways that you can send money from your balances.

The first is to go to one of your balances and send money from there.

  1. Go to **Home**

  2. Choose the balance that you’d like to send from — on web, you’ll see your accounts on the left-hand side of the screen; on the app, they’re at the top of the screen

  3. Click **Send**

  4. Enter the amount you want to send, choose a recipient, and enter a reference




The second way is to make a transfer as you normally would, and choose to send from your balance at the payment step. You won’t get the lower fees if you send money from your balance this way.

  1. Click on **Send money**

  2. Set up a transfer by going through the steps as you normally would

  3. At the payment step, choose the **Wise account transfer** option

  4. You may need to enter your Wise password, or use fingerprint or facial recognition, to finish sending money
