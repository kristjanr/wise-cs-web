# Sending money from your Wise account  
## How much does it cost to send money from a balance?  
If you’re sending money from your account to someone else's balance (of the same currency), it’s free.

If you’re sending money from your account to a bank account outside of Wise, we charge a fixed fee. 

We’ll always charge a conversion fee if you send money to a different currency.

To check how much the fee is, use our pricing page. Just type in the amount you want to send, and choose the currency you’re sending from and to. We’ll show you the exact fee you’ll need to pay. 

Please note, if you’re sending USD, EUR, or GBP to a country outside of the US, SEPA Zone or the UK — we’ll charge a higher fee.
