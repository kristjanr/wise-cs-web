# Sending large transfers  
## What if I want to send more than my bank allows?  
Your bank may limit the amount you can send in one transfer, or in one day. This can make it hard to send large amounts — but here are some ways to make it easier.

### Go to your bank branch in person

You can send larger amounts in one go if you go to your bank in person, rather than doing it online or over the phone.

It’s a good option if your bank is easy to get to, and you need to send money fast.

### Call your bank to increase the limit

Some banks let you increase your limits for a short amount of time, like 24 hours. Give your bank a call to see if they’ll let you do this.

This is a good option if it’s hard for you to get to your bank in person, and you need to send money fast. But not all banks do it.

### Add several smaller amounts to your balance, over a few days

To do this, open a balance in your Wise account. Then, add money to it over several days and hold it in your balance. Once you’ve added the full amount, go ahead and make your transfer. 

### Or, set up a transfer for the full amount and pay for it in several, smaller amounts

If you’d prefer not to open a balance, you can still set up a normal transfer for the full amount — and pay for it in several smaller amounts. To do this, set up your transfer as usual. Then pay in the first of the several, smaller amounts. This will trigger an email asking if:

  * you’ve made a mistake 

  * if your bank has limits and you’re paying for your transfer in several smaller amounts




Follow the instructions in your email to tell us you’ll be paying several smaller amounts. 

Keep in mind that if you pay for your transfer over several days, your guaranteed rate is likely to expire. This is because your rate is usually guaranteed for 24–48 hours, and we can only keep that rate if we get the full amount within that timeframe. 

**Tip:** The email you get at this stage is sent automatically — so it may be faster and smoother to arrange your transfer through this email, than it is to get in touch with us. 

**Reminder:** Always be sure to double check the specific currency you’ll be paying with and sending to — some of our currencies have limits on how much you can send.
