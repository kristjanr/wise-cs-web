# Sending large transfers  
## How long does a large transfer take?  
We do security checks when people send money abroad; they satisfy regulations, and help keep everyone safe. If you’re sending a larger amount, we often have to do extra manual checks, which can take longer.

We make this process as fast as possible, but we know sending large transfers can be particularly stressful. So here are some things you can do to speed things up.

### Set up your transfer with time to spare

The speed of your transfer depends on a few factors:

  * when you send it

  * which currencies you’re sending to and from

  * how you pay




We’ll give you a delivery estimate when you set up your transfer. It’s accurate around 60% of the time for larger amounts, because the extra checks can cause delays. So if you have to complete a transfer within a certain timeframe, set it up as soon as possible.

### Have your documents ready

Have your documents ready when you start your transfer. That way, if we ask for them, you can send them straight away and we can check them faster. Read about the documents you might need
