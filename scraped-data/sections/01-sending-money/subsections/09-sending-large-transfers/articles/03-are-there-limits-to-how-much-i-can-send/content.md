# Sending large transfers  
## Are there limits to how much I can send?  
Yes, there are limits for how much you can send with us. They depend on which currencies you send to and from, and how you pay. You can check the limits for each currency in the Currencies articles. Weâ€™ll also let you know if you try to send too much at one time.
