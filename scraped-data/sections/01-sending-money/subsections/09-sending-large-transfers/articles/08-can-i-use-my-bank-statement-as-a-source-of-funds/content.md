# Sending large transfers  
## Can I use my bank statement as a source of funds?  
We can accept a bank statement as proof of where you got your money if it includes:

  * the full amount you’re transferring with us

  * the origin of that money with clear references on the credit transactions

  * and your name and account information




If your statement doesn’t include this, we’ll need to see supporting documentation. This might be a house sale agreement, or proof of inheritance, for example.

And if your money has come from your savings or salary, you won’t need to show us the full amount. Instead, we’ll ask for 3 months of statements, showing regular payment transactions with clear references.
