# Sending large transfers  
## Why do I need to prove where my money comes from?  
When you send a large amount, we might need to see proof of where you got the money you’re sending. This is a regulatory requirement, and it helps us keep Wise safe for everyone.

If we ask to see where you got your money, we’ll need you to provide a document that shows the movement of that money. That might be:

  * a bank statement

  * an investment or savings certificate

  * or a letter from a solicitor confirming you received money from inheritance, for example
