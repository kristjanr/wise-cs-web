# Sending large transfers  
## Can I make an urgent large transfer?  
Unfortunately, we can’t send large amounts of money urgently.

If you’re sending a large amount, it’ll usually take the same amount of time to process as regular transfer. Sometimes, we need to run security checks on payments, but we do our best to send them as quickly as we can.

If your payment is time-sensitive, then please get in touch with our specialised team. We can help you get prepared for your transfer in advance, which usually helps to speed things along.
