## Sending GBP to countries outside of the UK  
With Wise, you can send British pounds (GBP) to bank accounts in countries outside of the UK. You can also now send GBP to bank accounts in the UK that Wise otherwise can’t support. These are bank accounts that don’t accept CHAPS or Faster Payments.

As long as the receiving bank account is denominated in GBP and has an IBAN, you can send GBP there.

We send GBP to bank accounts outside of the UK using the SWIFT payment network. It’s different than a regular Wise transfer, so it’ll take a bit longer to reach the recipient. 

### How it works

  1.  **Set up your transfer on Wise.** You’ll need to add a new recipient to get started.

  2.  **Add the IBAN number of the recipient’s bank account.**

  3.  **Pay for your transfer.** We’ll then send the GBP to your recipient as usual.




### How much it costs

 **Your fee:** It costs us extra to send money by SWIFT, so we’ll add that amount to the regular Wise fee.

For the most up to date information on your fees, please see the Terms of Use for your region.

 **Your recipient’s fee:** Your recipient’s bank may charge fees to receive payments sent with SWIFT. Also, the recipient might be charged by any banks that handle the money along the way. We don’t have control over when these fees are charged, or how much they cost.
