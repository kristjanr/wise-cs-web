# Sending money basics  
## How long does a transfer take?  
We always move your money as quickly as possible. You can see an estimate of how long it’ll take by putting some basic details into our transfer calculator on our homepage.

But when you actually set up your transfer on Wise, your estimate will change. The reason for this is simple — the more information we have about your transfer, the more accurately we can tell you how long it’ll take. And it depends on these 4 things:

####  **The countries you’re sending from and to.**

Every currency and country is different. Converting your money can take a maximum of 2 working days, but it’s very rare that it takes this long. And how quick your transfer arrives depends on how quickly your recipient’s bank can process your money, as well as the ways you can pay in the country you’re sending from. We can't confirm when the money has reached and been processed by your recipient's bank.

####  **How you pay.**

Some payment methods are quicker than others. For instance, card payments are normally instant, while bank transfers can take longer, especially SWIFT transfers. You’ll see how long each payment method takes when you set up your transfer.

####  **What time you pay for your transfer.**

We can only move your money during normal banking hours. And things may take a little longer if the country you’re sending to has a national holiday.

####  **Security checks.**

We might need to verify things like your ID, address, or where you got the money from, when you make a transfer. We call this process verification, and it helps us keep you and your money safe. These additional checks can add extra time to your transfer on top of the initial estimation.
