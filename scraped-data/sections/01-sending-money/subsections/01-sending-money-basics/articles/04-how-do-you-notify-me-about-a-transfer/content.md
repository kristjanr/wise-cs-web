# Sending money basics  
## How do you notify me about a transfer?  
We’ll send you an email when we’ve received your money, and when we’ve paid your transfer out. This doesn’t mean it’s reached your recipient yet.

If there’s an issue with your transfer, we’ll also send you an email. So, make sure you keep an eye on that when you set up a transfer. If you don’t get an email, check your spam or junk folder in case it’s been sent there.

Most contact will come via email, but we might get in touch by phone if needed.
