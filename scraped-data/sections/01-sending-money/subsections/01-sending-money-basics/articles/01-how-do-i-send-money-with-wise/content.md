# Sending money basics  
## How do I send money with Wise?  
**1.** **Sign up** **with Wise.**

We’ll ask for your email address, and you’ll create a password. You can also sign up by connecting to your Google or Facebook account. 

**Tip:** If you already have a Wise account, go to **Home** on the website and choose **Send money** , or tap **Send** on the app, to set up a transfer. 

**2\. Type in how much you’d like to transfer.**

You can start with the amount you’d like to send, **or** how much you’d like your recipient to get. 

**Tip:** If it’s important that your recipient gets an exact amount, type that amount into the Recipient gets box. We’ll automatically tell you how much you need to send.

 **3\. Let us know what kind of transfer you’re making.**

If you’re paying in from a personal bank account, it’s a Personal transfer. 

**4\. Fill in your details.**

We’ll ask for your personal details, like your address. We need this info to comply with finance regulations, but we’ll never share it. 

**5\. Tell us who you’re sending money to.**

If you have their bank details, add them in and we’ll send money to that account.

If you don’t have their bank details, just enter their email address.

  * If they’re on Wise, we’ll find the account they want to receive money into.

  * If they’re not on Wise, we’ll send them an email asking for their bank details.




 **6\. Review the details of your transfer.**

Make sure everything looks right. You can add a reference for your recipient if you’d like.

 **7\. Choose your transfer type and how to pay**

We’ll let you know the fees for each option, and how long it should take the money to arrive. 

**Tip:** It’s often cheapest to pay from your bank account. This means you’ll have to go to your online banking or your branch, and then send the money to Wise.

 **8\. That’s it!**

After we’ve received your money, we’ll confirm the transfer via email, or in the app. And we’ll also let you and your recipient know when the money’s on its way.
