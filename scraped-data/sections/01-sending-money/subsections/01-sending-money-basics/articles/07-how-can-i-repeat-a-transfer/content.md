## How can I repeat a transfer?  
If you’ve made a transfer before and want to repeat it, you can do this automatically from 3 different places:

  * When you are logged in to Wise, click on the transfer you wish to repeat. Then choose **Repeat transfer**. You’ll have a chance to review all the details before you confirm the transfer and pay

  * From the transfer page of a completed transfer. Click **Repeat this transfer** in the top right-hand corner

  * From a payment confirmation page. You can access the transfer status page from the link in the email we send you when a transfer has been completed. Just click **Repeat this transfer** in the top right-hand corner when you reach the transfer status page




This will create a transfer with exactly the same details as your previous transfer, except with the current mid-market exchange rate.
