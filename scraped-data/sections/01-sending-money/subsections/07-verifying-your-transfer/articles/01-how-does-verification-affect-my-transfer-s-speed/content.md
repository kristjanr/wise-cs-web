# Verifying your transfer  
## How does verification affect my transfer's speed?  
If we ask to verify you after your transfer is in progress, we’ll work to get it done within 5-14 working days for personal and business customers alike. Once we’ve successfully verified you or your business, we’ll automatically resume your transfer and let you know by email.

If we need more information to finish verifying you, we’ll send you an email. We won’t be able to send your transfer until we finish verifying you, so keep an eye on your emails — including the spam folder — so your transfer doesn’t get delayed.
