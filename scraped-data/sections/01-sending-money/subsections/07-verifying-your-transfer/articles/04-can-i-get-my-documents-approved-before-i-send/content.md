# Verifying your transfer  
## Can I get my documents approved before I send?  
We can’t approve your documents before you send a transfer. As we review transfers on a case by case basis, there’s no way to know what documents we’ll need until we’ve received your deposit.

We can advise you on what documents we think we might need, however. Get in touch, and we’ll do our best to prepare you for your transfer.

In the meantime, you can see the list of documents we accept, or learn more about sending your documents.
