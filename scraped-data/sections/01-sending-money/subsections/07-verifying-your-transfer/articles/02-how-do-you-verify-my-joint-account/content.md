# Verifying your transfer  
## How do you verify my joint account?  
We need you to upload a screenshot or PDF of your bank statement where we can see:

  * your first and last name

  * the first and last name of the other account holder 

  * the account number

  * the bank name 




Upload your bank statement

We don’t always need to verify joint accounts, only when the names aren’t sent to us correctly by your bank with your transfer.
