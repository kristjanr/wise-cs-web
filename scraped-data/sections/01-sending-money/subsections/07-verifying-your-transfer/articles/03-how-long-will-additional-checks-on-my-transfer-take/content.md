# Verifying your transfer  
## How long will additional checks on my transfer take?  
While we try to process all transfers as fast as possible, sometimes we have to carry out checks on them, to keep your money safe.

These checks usually take 2–10 working days, but occasionally they can take longer. We’ll usually update the delivery estimate to take this into account, so check it to see when your transfer will arrive.

We have to do these checks because Wise is a regulated financial institution. It doesn’t mean there’s anything wrong with your transfer.

So, if your transfer is taking a little longer, don’t worry. If we need any extra information from you, we’ll get in touch. Just keep an eye on your email — including your spam inbox — for any messages from us. And you can check your transfer progress in the Activity section of your Wise account.
