## Paying with PayPal  
PayPal is a EUR payment method that is available for accounts located within the European Economic Area (EEA). It’s a simple and convenient way to pay for your transfer if you use Wise for personal reasons — unfortunately, it’s not available for businesses yet.

PayPal pay-in is now available on our website and mobile apps (iOS and Android). The name on your PayPal account must match the name on your Wise account — if the names don’t match, we can’t process your transfer.

For now, we can only accept payments from PayPal wallets denominated in EUR.

 **How much does it cost?**

Cross currency: eg EUR->GBP:

  * Base cost: flat fee - 0.35, variable fee: 0.36%

For same currency: EUR->EUR, it’s:

  * Pay-in cost: flat fee - 0, variable fee: 0.41%




You can find more information on how much each transfer costs in total on our pricing page, as our conversion fees vary based on the target currency of your transfer.

 **How long does it take?**

We should receive your payment instantly. If you need a refund, you should receive it in your PayPal wallet instantly after the transfer cancellation.

 **How much can I send?**

You can send up to three transfers of up to 2,500 EUR per transfer, 3 times per day via PayPal.

 **How do I pay with PayPal?**

  1. Set up a transfer as you normally would.

  2. At the payment step, choose the PayPal option under the “Fast transfer” category.

  3. The first time you use this payment method, you’ll be redirected to PayPal’s login page.

  4. Log in to your PayPal account.

  5. Agree to the terms and confirm the payment.

  6. Your money should then be on its way to us.




 **What issues could I encounter?**

If you don’t have enough money in your PayPal wallet when starting the payment on Wise, the payment will fail. 

But if your PayPal wallet is linked to an external bank account, PayPal may collect the money via a Direct Debit.
