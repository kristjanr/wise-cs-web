## Problems paying by bank transfer  
Here are some solutions to the most common problems that people have when paying by bank transfer.

### I didn’t include the reference number

When you pay by bank transfer, we show you a reference number with the rest of our bank details. This number helps us identify which payment is yours. You’ll need to include the number in the reference field when setting up a payment from your bank account.

If you didn’t include the reference number, your transfer might be delayed while we try to find your money. To help us find it, you’ll need to upload a proof of payment document. Once you upload your proof, someone on our team will be in touch.

### I sent the wrong amount

When you set up a transfer, make sure to send us the correct amount of money. We’ll show you exactly how much to send, along with the rest of our bank details.

If you sent us more than needed, we’ll refund the excess once we’ve completed the transfer.

If you sent us less than needed, we’ll pause the transfer and email you to ask what you’d like to do next.

### My bank account name and Wise name don’t match

When you send us a payment, the name on the bank account where the money is coming from must match your name on Wise. The only exceptions are if you’re paying from a joint account, or if you’re paying as a business through your Wise Business account.

If someone else pays for your transfer, you’ll need to cancel it. You can set it up again and pay for it from your own account.

### I made a mistake with Wises’ bank details

When you’re paying by bank transfer, always double check that the bank details you’ve entered for Wise match the ones we show you in the bank transfer details screen. If you do make a mistake, the money will likely be rejected and come back to you.
