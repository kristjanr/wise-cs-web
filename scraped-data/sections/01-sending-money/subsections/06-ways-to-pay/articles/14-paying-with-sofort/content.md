# Ways to pay  
## Paying with SOFORT  
SOFORT is a convenient payment method that works through your online banking. Here’s some basic information about how it works.

  * SOFORT is only available for selected banks in Austria, Belgium, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Slovakia, Spain, and Switzerland. If it doesn’t work with your bank, we’ll let you know when you set up the transfer

  * SOFORT securely pulls money from your bank account to pay for your transfer

  * You need to have enough money in your bank account before you pay by SOFORT

  * The name on your bank account must match the name on your Wise account — if the names don’t match, we can’t process your transfer. You’ll need to cancel the transfer, and get a refund




### How much does it cost?

You can find information on how much each payment method costs on our pricing page. 

### How long does it take?

SOFORT transfers usually take between 0–4 working days to arrive. We’ll always give you an estimate of when your money will arrive when you set the transfer up. If your payment isn’t instant, there’s unfortunately nothing we can do to speed it up. 

### How much can I send?

You can send up to 25,000 EUR every 24 hours by SOFORT. If you’d like to send more, send it in multiple transfers over a longer period of time. Or, use another payment method, like a bank transfer.
