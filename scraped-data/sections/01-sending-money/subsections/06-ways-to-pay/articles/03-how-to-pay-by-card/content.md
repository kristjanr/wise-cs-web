## How to pay by card  
We’ll show you the available payment methods when you’re paying for your transfer. For most currencies, you can pay using your debit or credit card. 

We only accept Visa, Mastercard, and some Maestro cards. Your card has to have a 16-digit card number, an expiry date and 3D security enabled. We don't accept American Express (AMEX) cards. 

We currently can’t accept payments from:

  * Payment cards not in your name or your business' name

  * US issued cards, if the address on your Wise account is outside the US. 

  * All cards issued in Argentina, China, and Nigeria

  * Business cards issued in Russia and Belarus

  * Prepaid cards from the UAE, or international payments from an AED currency card

  * Credit cards issued in Singapore

  * any card when you're paying for MYR transfers or balance top ups

  * any card if your address is in Turkey




### How much does it cost to pay with my card?

We’re always up front about our fees, check our pricing page to see what you’d be charged if you paid with your card. 

Keep in mind, paying with a credit card or business card means you’ll be charged a higher fee — it costs us more to process them.

### Paying by card for your business transfers

If you’re paying for a transfer on your Wise Business account, make sure you pay using your business card. You can’t pay for business payments from a personal bank account. 

### International card payments

An international card payment means you paid using a card not issued in the country you’re paying with. For example, you paid EUR from your card that was issued in Canada. 

When you pay with an international card, you’ll be charged more fees. We have to charge a higher fee because it costs us more to process them. And your bank might charge a fee to convert your money for you too. 

If you’re paying a currency from the EEA, using your EEA issued card, you won’t be charged international card fees. 

### Unsuccessful card payments

When your card payment fails, we’ll show you an error message. Here are common reasons why a card payment might fail.

### Cancelling your card payment

If you need to cancel a transfer that was paid for with your debit or credit card, find the transfer in the Activity section of your account, and select **Cancel transfer**. 

Once cancelled, debit card refunds can take up to 10 working days to process, but are usually back in your account in 2–5 working days. You can only cancel uncompleted transactions.
