# Ways to pay  
## Paying by Open Banking  
**Open Banking is a secure and convenient way of topping up your Wise account or paying for your GBP transfer.** Open Banking was initiated by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) in 2017. 

Wise has two pay-in Open Banking options right now: one-off payment and one or more pull of funds to Wise account. Pull of funds option can be set up by connecting Wise to your bank account in another bank.

Open banking one-off pay-in is more convenient than manual transfer because we will redirect you straight to your bank and you will have all payment details pre-filled. If you connect your bank account to Wise you won’t be required to login to the bank next time. 

To make a one-off payment or to connect a bank account, all you have to do is log in to your bank, select which account you want to use and click to confirm. It’s completely safe and secure and will take only a few steps to set up.
