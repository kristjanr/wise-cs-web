## How to use microdeposits  
If you’re making a transfer from the US, and you set up an ACH bank debit for your USD transfer, we need to verify that your bank account belongs to you. If we’re unable to do this with your bank login details, we might be able to verify you with microdeposits.

This means we’ll send two small amounts (between 0.01-0.99 USD) to your account, which will appear on your bank statement. It can take up to 2 business days for these to arrive. 

After you receive these, you'll need to enter the amounts on Wise to immediately verify your bank account.

### How do I enter the amounts of the microdeposits? 

As soon as you see the microdeposits in your account, you can enter the amounts on your transfer page and this will immediately verify your account. You can do this only in the website. You can also enter them on the website without the transfer page:

  1. Click on your profile in the top right corner

  2. Click **Settings**

  3. Go to **Connected accounts**

  4. Choose **Complete verification**

  5. Click **Continue** and enter the amount




### Will I have to do this every time? 

**If you have**2-step verification **enabled on your Wise account**

You won’t have to verify your bank account again for old or new recipients. If you’re paying from a **new** bank account for the first time, you might have to verify using microdeposits. 

**If you don’t have 2-step verification enabled on your Wise account**

You’ll have to verify your bank account each time you send to a new recipient.
