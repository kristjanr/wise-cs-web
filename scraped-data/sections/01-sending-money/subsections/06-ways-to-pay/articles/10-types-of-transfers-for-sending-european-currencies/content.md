## Types of transfers for sending European currencies  
There are 2 types of transfers you can use to send money from European currencies apart from EUR: Fast and easy, and Low cost transfers.

You can choose from these transfers when sending PLN, HUF, RON, BGN, CZK, SEK, NOK, and DKK. 

### Fast and easy transfer

This type of transfer is the most convenient way to send money abroad on Wise. It’s also faster to set up — you just need to type in your card details, or use your fingerprint with Apple Pay or Google Pay.

But processing these transactions is more expensive for businesses like Wise.

Here’s why: firstly, with Fast and easy transfers, your money isn’t sent to Wise instantly. As a result, Wise needs to do extra work to speed it up.

Secondly, when you use your card — or pay with Apple or Google Pay — you get extra support from Wise to keep your money safe if you’re unlucky enough to have your card used fraudulently.

All these things make Fast and easy transfers more expensive. But Wise doesn’t make any more profit — it simply covers the extra costs associated with this type of transfer.

### Low cost transfer

This type of transfer is for customers who want the most from their money. 

You can do this using a manual bank transfer, or by using the money in your balances. Wise doesn’t need to do extra work to speed up your transfer. As a result, we can offer Low cost transfers at a much cheaper price.

Keep in mind, a manual bank transfer might be slightly harder to make and slower to reach us, because you’ll need to send the money to Wise as a separate transaction.
