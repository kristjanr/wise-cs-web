# Ways to pay  
## Can I pay by ACH electronic payment?  
Yes, but we don’t encourage this, as an ACH Debit is much easier and safer.

If you do need to make an ACH electronic payment though, it’s helpful to know that if you’re in a licensed state, you can use the same account details for payments to Wise for both wire and electronic payments.

If you’re in a state where we work with our partner, the routing number for wire and electronic payments is different. The electronic payment routing number is **026073150**.

If you’re unsure whether the payment you’re making is a wire or electronic, you can check with your bank to avoid any delays, or entering the wrong information.
