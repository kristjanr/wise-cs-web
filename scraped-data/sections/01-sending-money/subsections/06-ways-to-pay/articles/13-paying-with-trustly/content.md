# Ways to pay  
## Paying with Trustly  
Trustly is a convenient payment method that works through your online banking. Here’s some basic information about how it works.

  * Trustly is only available for bank accounts in Estonia and Finland in the Eurozone, and bank accounts in Sweden and Denmark outside the Eurozone

  * The name on your bank account must match the name on your Wise account — if the names don’t match, we won’t be able to process your transfer

  * Trustly doesn’t support payments from businesses — use a different payment method, like card or bank transfer, instead




### How much does it cost?

You can find information on how much each payment method costs on our pricing page. 

### How long does it take?

Usually, it takes between 0–2 working days. The time it takes often depends on the bank you’re sending from. This is because some banks may have limits on how much money you can send instantly through Trustly. 

We’ll give you an estimate for how long it’ll take when you set up your transfer. 

### How much can I send?

How much you can send with Trustly depends on what currency you’re sending from. You can send up to:

  * 1.2 million EUR

  * 8.5 million DKK

  * 12.5 million SEK




However, your bank may have its own limits on how much you can send at a time.
