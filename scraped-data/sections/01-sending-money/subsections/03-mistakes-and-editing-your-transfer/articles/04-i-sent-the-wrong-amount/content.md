# Mistakes and editing your transfer  
## I sent the wrong amount  
It can be unsettling to send the wrong amount of money. But fortunately, it’s straightforward to fix.

 **If you sent too much money, we’ll send the excess back to you.**

If you set up your transfer on Wise — and accidentally paid too much money — you don’t need to do anything.

Our system knows when you’ve paid too much. So we’ll send the amount you wanted to send to your recipient. Then, we’ll refund the excess back to the bank account you paid from.

 **Tip:** You don’t need to contact us to get a refund. In rare cases where we need more information, we’ll get in touch by email.

 **If you haven’t sent enough money, you can either pay the outstanding amount. Or we’ll email you to get it fixed.**

We’ll only complete your transfer once you’ve paid the full amount. So if you didn’t pay enough money, we’ll pause your transfer.

You can either:

  * Log back in to Wise, find the transfer in question in Activity, and pay the outstanding amount. This is a good option if you need your transfer to continue straight away.

  * Or, wait for us to email you. The email will ask whether you’d like to complete the transfer with the amount you’ve already sent. Or whether you’d like to pay the outstanding amount. Either way, you’ll be guided through the next steps.
