# Mistakes and editing your transfer  
## I forgot the reference  
If you didn’t include your unique reference number (beginning with P) with your bank transfer to us or you think this may not have been correctly forwarded by the bank, you’ll need to upload a proof of payment document - we’ll use it to identify your money.

Once you’ve uploaded your proof of payment document, we’ll be in touch with you to help.
