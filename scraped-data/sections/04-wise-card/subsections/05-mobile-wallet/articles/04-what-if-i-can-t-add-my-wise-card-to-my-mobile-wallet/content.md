## What if I can't add my Wise card to my mobile wallet?  
There are some situations where you might have trouble adding your Wise card to your mobile wallet.

### If you haven’t received the SMS code

If you don’t get the SMS code, you won’t be able to finish adding your card to your mobile wallet. Try sending the code again, and if that doesn’t work, try sending it by email.

### If you have an international phone number in your Wise account

If you got your card in the US, but you don’t have a US phone number, you won’t be able to add your card to your mobile wallet right now. This is because our system can’t send the authentication text to an international number. Sorry about that. We’re working on fixing this, and we’ll let you know when we do.
