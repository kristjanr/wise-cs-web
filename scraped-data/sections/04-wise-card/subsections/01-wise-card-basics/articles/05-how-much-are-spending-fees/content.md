# Wise card basics  
## How much are spending fees?  
#### For the most up to date information on your fees, please see the Terms of Use for your region.

There’s a lot you can do with your Wise card for free. And we charge transparent fees for spending in currencies you don’t have in your account and withdrawing cash after a certain amount.

### Getting your card

We might ask you to add money to your balance or pay a small fee to get the card.

### Spending with your card 

  * If you have the currency in your account, it’s free

  * If you don’t have the currency in your account, there’s a conversion fee. Check our pricing. 

  * For Brazil cardholders: please keep in mind that the smart conversion will not work for Brazilian cards when the BRL balance is involved. You can learn more here. 

  * If you’re spending online, the seller might try to charge their own conversion fee. This could happen even if you have the other currency in your account. To avoid this, ask the seller to charge you in the currency you want




 ** _Keep in mind:_** Because of the ongoing sanctions and recent developments in the region, the National Bank of the Republic of Belarus now requires all card transactions to use a conversion rate set by them for BYN payments. This means that we can no longer use the mid-market rate to calculate fees when you spend or withdraw money with your Wise card in **Belarus**. Instead, we’re now using the rate set by the National Bank. Change is in effect from 16 May 2022, and only affects BYN payments. 

### Withdrawing cash from an ATM

You get 2 free withdrawals up to 200 GBP total (or whatever currency is equivalent) per month.

### Replacing your card 

If you need to replace your card, you might need to pay a small fee to receive a new one. It helps us cover the cost of getting it made and delivered to you.
