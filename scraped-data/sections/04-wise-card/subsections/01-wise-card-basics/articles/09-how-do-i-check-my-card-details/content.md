# Wise card basics  
## How do I check my card details?  
You can check your card details on the app or website if you live in Europe, the UK, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Malaysia, Japan, Brazil or Canada — even if you haven’t received your physical card yet. You can use your card details online or with your mobile wallet before you get your physical card.

#### To check your card details on the app

  1. Go to **Card**

  2. Select **Card details**

  3. You may need to enter your Wise password, or use fingerprint or facial recognition, to view your card details




#### To check your card details on the website

  1. Go to your Wise account

  2. Select the **Cards** tab on the left-hand side

  3. Select **Show card details**

  4. You may need to enter your Wise password to view your card details




Make sure to only ever save your card details with websites and apps you know and trust. And don’t hesitate to report suspicious activity on your card.
