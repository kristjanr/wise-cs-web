# Wise card basics  
## Getting started with your Wise digital card  
Just like your physical card, the digital card lets you spend money around the world with low conversion fees in a secure way. 

You can get a digital card if you already have a physical card and live in the UK, Australia, Japan, New Zealand, Singapore, Malaysia, Switzerland, EEA, Brazil or Canada.

Your digital card is ready to be used the moment you’ve requested it. No activation or PIN needed. 

### Using your digital card(s)

 **Have more than one card**

In addition to your physical card, you can have up to 3 digital cards at one time.
