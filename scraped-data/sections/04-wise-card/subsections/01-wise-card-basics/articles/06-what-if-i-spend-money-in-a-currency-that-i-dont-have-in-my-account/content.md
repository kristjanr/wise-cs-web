# Wise card basics  
## What if I spend money in a currency that I don’t have in my account?  
If you don’t have the currency you need in your account, you can still spend money. Our Smart Conversion technology will automatically convert the balance for you that has the lowest conversion fee. 

If the currencies that you hold in your account have the same conversion fees, we'll use the one with the best exchange rate, so you get the most for your money.

You can calculate our conversion fees between different currencies for card transactions using our pricing page. 

You can’t set a default or preferred balance to convert from. 

Here are some examples of how our conversion technology works.

  * If you’re buying something for 100 EUR and you have 150 EUR in your account, it’s free to spend

  * If you’re buying something for 100 EUR and you don’t have a EUR account, we’ll convert the amount needed from your available balances, and charge a conversion fee

  * If you’re buying something for 100 EUR and you only have 90 EUR, but you have money in your USD account, then we’ll use the 90 EUR, and convert the rest from your USD account, charging a conversion fee




### For Brazil cardholders

The smart conversion will not work for Brazilian cards when the BRL account is involved. If you try to spend in a currency that you don’t have and BRL is the only available currency, the transaction will be declined due to insufficient funds.
