# Wise card basics  
## Naming your Wise card  
You can add a label to your Wise cards. This will make it easier to find the one you want to use. 

To add a label to your card:

  * Open your Wise account on your app or the website

  * Tap on **Card**

  * Select the card youâ€™d like to label

  * Click on **Set card label** under the **Manage card** section

  * Type in the label and tap **Save**




The name can be up to 20 characters, including spaces. You can also use emojis.

To edit a label, simply follow the same steps. To remove a label, just delete the name and save without adding any characters.

This feature is available on the app and the website for all personal and business cards.
