# Wise card basics  
## What are my spending limits?  
Your Wise card comes with default and maximum limits. You can always choose either one in your Wise app or desktop version, or turn off a specific type of payment completely. 

There are different limits for cardholders in different countries, so keep in mind where you ordered your card.

 **Contactless:** common in Europe, UK, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Singapore or Canada. You might have to enter your PIN the first time.

**ATM withdrawal:** ATMs could have their own limits and might charge an additional fee. ****Learn more about ATM fees. 

**Daily limit:** refreshes every day at midnight. Check the exact time in the app.

**Monthly limit:** refreshes on the first day of each month.
