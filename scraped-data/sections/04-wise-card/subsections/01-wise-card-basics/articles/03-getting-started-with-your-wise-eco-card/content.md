# Wise card basics  
## Getting started with your Wise eco card  
We’re launching an eco-friendly card made of a _biodegradable material_ to reduce plastic waste. 

To use less ink, the card will only have your name printed on it. _You can check your full card details on your Wise account_.

The Eco card is available for personal customers in the EEA and the UK. Just click on the **Cards** tab on your account to order one. 

If you already have a Wise card, you can order an Eco card as a second card. Your Wise card will continue to work until the expiry date. You can’t replace an expiring standard Wise card with an Eco card, you need to order them separately. 

If you don’t have a Wise card yet, you can choose if you want to order a standard or an Eco card when you place a card order. 

Eco cards work the same way as your standard card. You can use them everywhere where you can use the Wise card.

The limits are also the same for the standard card and the Eco card.
