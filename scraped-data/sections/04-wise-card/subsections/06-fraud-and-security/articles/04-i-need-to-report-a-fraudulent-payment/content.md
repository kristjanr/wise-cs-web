## I need to report a fraudulent payment  
If you notice a payment in your Activity that you didn’t make, it may not be fraud. It could be a pending or delayed payment and will be resolved soon. So if you don’t recognise a transaction, check if it could be one of these things:

  *  **Pending payments from petrol/gas stations**. Petrol stations often preauthorise a maximum or estimated amount. The amount you actually spent should be charged in 1–3 days, and the rest will be automatically refunded to your account 

  * **Payments made offline.** Transactions made during a flight or at a food truck are often delayed, so may appear in your activity when you’re not expecting it.

  *  **Unfamiliar business names.** Transactions are sometimes listed under a different trading name to the business you’re familiar with. Google the name to see if you recognise it.

  *  **Unexpected small charges.** Businesses might charge your card for a small amount to make sure it works. This is common for hotels and car rentals. These small charges will usually be refunded within a few days. 

  * **Subscriptions**. Free trials can lead to unexpected subscription charges. If this happens, get in touch with the merchant to ask for a refund, or cancel the subscription. Click here to learn more about unexpected subscription charges.
