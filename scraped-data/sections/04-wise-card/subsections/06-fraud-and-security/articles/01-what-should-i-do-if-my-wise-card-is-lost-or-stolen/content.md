## What should I do if my Wise card is lost or stolen?  
You have two options if your Wise card has been lost or stolen. You can temporarily freeze your card to prevent someone using it, or replace it to get a brand new card. 

### I want to freeze my card

If you lost your card, don’t recognise a transaction or just don’t want to use it for a while — freeze it to keep your money safe.

While your card is frozen, you won’t be able to use it to make any transactions. Once you’re ready to use your card again, you can defrost it by following the same steps. 

On the app:

  1. Open the Wise app

  2. Tap on **Card**

  3. Select **Freeze card**




On the website:

  1. Log in to your Wise account

  2. Select **Cards**

  3. Select **Freeze card**




### I want to replace my card 

If your card is stolen, damaged or lost permanently, you can replace it using the Wise app or website.

On the app:

  1. Go to the **Card** tab

  2. Choose **Replace card**

  3. Choose one of the options on the screen




On the website:

  1. Select **Cards**

  2. Select **Replace card**

  3. Select one of the options on the screen




If you choose "I lost my card" or "My card was stolen", we’ll block and cancel your card immediately, and you’ll be able to order a new card. 

### How long will it take to get a replacement card?
