## I don't recognise a subscription on my account  
If you spot an unwanted subscription, it’s best to get in touch directly with the merchant who charged you.

If you recognise the merchant name, you might have signed up for a subscription with them — especially if you’ve given them your card details in the past. 

To cancel, **get in touch with the merchant directly**. There’s no need to contact us. 

#### Here are a few examples:

**Amazon Prime** — If you see a charge on your account from Amazon Prime/UK Prime, this means you’ve signed up for an Amazon Prime subscription.

Contact Amazon customer support to manage this subscription or click here to find out more about cancelling it.

 **Apple.com** — **Apple.com/bill** **** appears on your billing statement when you buy an app, music, movie, or other content from Apple. It also appears when a subscription renews, or when a family member buys apps or content from Apple. 

Find out more about this on Apple's support page

 **eDreams Prime** — **** eDreams Prime is a service offered by eDreams **.** It often **** starts as a **free trial** that renews automatically. You can get in touch with their support to end the subscription and request a refund. **Free trials** — If you sign up for a free trial and forget to cancel, it might automatically become a paid subscription.

Always pay attention to the Terms of Use you’re accepting. If they say that you’ll be signed up for a subscription and you tick the “I agree” box, you might be charged.

 **Discreet billing** — If you see a subscription charge from a merchant you don’t recognise, it could be an adult content or online dating subscription. Often they’ll use a different name which will show up on your account. This is called discreet billing.

These merchants usually have a website in the merchant name. If you head to this website, you can cancel the subscription.

If you’re sure you’ve cancelled the subscription but are still being charged, you can submit a dispute to us. Choose “I was charged for a subscription I cancelled” as the reason for submitting a dispute.

 **Tip:** If you sign up for a free trial, set a reminder on your phone for a few days before it ends. That way you can cancel in time before you’re charged for a full subscription.

If you still want to file our dispute form for this subscription, make sure to send us the communication with the merchant and their terms and conditions.

In case you've already cancelled your subscription, we also suggest to get in touch with the merchant and ask for a refund. If they're not able to help, file our dispute form, send us the cancellation confirmation, and we’ll take care of it for you.
