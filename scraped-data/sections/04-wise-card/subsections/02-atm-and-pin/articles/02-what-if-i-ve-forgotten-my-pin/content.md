# ATM and PIN  
## What if I've forgotten my PIN?  
How you find and change your PIN depends on the country you got your card in. Here’s what to do if you forget your PIN.

### UK, EEA, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Malaysia, Japan, Brazil and Canada cardholders

When you complete your card order, we’ll share your PIN with you.

If you forget it, you can always check it in the Wise app or website:

  1. Go to your Wise account.

  2. If you’re on the website, go to **Cards**. If you’re on the app, go to **Card.**

  3. Select **Show PIN**.

  4. You may need to enter your Wise password, or use fingerprint or facial recognition, to check your PIN.




You may be able to change your PIN in the EEA and UK at some ATMs — and you can only choose a 4-digit PIN.

### US cardholders

You’ll choose your own PIN once you activate your Wise card. Unfortunately, we can’t remind you what your PIN is if you live in the US. So, if you forget it, you’ll have to set a new one in the Wise app or website. To do this:

  1. If you’re on the website, go to **Cards.** If you’re on the app, go to **Card.**

  2. Click on **Change PIN**

  3. Type the desired PIN number twice and you’re good to go.




You’ll only be able to change your PIN while you’re in the US. Remember, you can only choose a 4-digit PIN. 

### What do I do if my PIN is blocked? 

If you enter the wrong PIN 3 times, we’ll block it and you won’t be able to use your card. If this happens, you’ll need to unblock your PIN in the Wise app. To do this:

  1. Open your Wise app

  2. Go to **Card**

  3. Choose **Unblock PIN**




You’ll now be able to use your card online. But to use contactless again with your card, you’ll need to make a payment using your chip and PIN first.
