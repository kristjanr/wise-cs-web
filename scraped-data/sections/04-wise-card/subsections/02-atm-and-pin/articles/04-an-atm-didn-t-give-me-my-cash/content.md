# ATM and PIN  
## An ATM didn't give me my cash  
In most cases, the ATM provider will know that there was an error, and the money will automatically be returned to your balance within a few minutes.

If that doesnâ€™t happen, you have 2 options:

### Contact the ATM provider first

Every ATM has a contact number. Call them and tell them what happened; they should be able to fix things. Before you call, have the transaction date and time, and the ATM code and operation number, handy.

### If the transaction is pending

If the transaction is marked as pending in your activity, the money should automatically return to your account in 7 days.

### If the transaction is completed

If the transaction is marked as completed in your activity, submit a dispute.
