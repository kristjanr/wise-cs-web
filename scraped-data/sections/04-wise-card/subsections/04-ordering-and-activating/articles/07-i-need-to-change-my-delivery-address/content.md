# Ordering and activating  
## I need to change my delivery address  
**The delivery address doesn’t have to be the address on your account.**

For instance, you can order the card to your office, or to a friend or relative’s place. 

**If the address on your account isn’t correct.**

If you’ve moved and would like to change your account address, you can do it in the app or on the website, but you might have to submit a document. Here’s how we verify your address.

**You can edit your delivery address before you finish your card order:**

  1. Go to the **Cards** tab on the web, or **Card** tab on the app

  2. Click on **Your debit card order** on the web, or select **Finish your card order** on the app

  3. Select **Edit address**

  4. Edit the delivery address and click **Continue**

  5. Complete all required steps to finish your card order




 **If you ordered it and the delivery estimate has passed**

If you ordered a card but it never arrived — and the delivery estimate has passed — you can order a new one to a different address without our help. Here’s how:

  1. Go to your Wise account in the app or on the website

  2. Open the **Cards** tab on the website, or the **Card** tab in app 

  3. Select **Order a new one** (Note that if you order a new card this way, your original card will be cancelled automatically and you won’t be able to activate it)

  4. Select **Cancel the old card**

  5. Select **Continue**




 **If you ordered your card, but it hasn’t shipped yet, or it’s been shipped but the delivery estimate hasn’t passed.**

We can cancel the card and help you order a new one.
