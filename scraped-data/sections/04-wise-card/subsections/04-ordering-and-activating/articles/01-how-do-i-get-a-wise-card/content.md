### Can I get the card?

The Wise card is currently available in the UK, the US, Switzerland, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Malaysia, Japan, Canada, Brazil and most of the EEA. There are a few exceptions, so check the list of eligible countries.

 **We can’t issue the card to people who don’t live in these countries.** We’re working hard to expand and have our card available in other places. If you’d like the card in your country, join our waitlist.

### How to get the Wise card

 **1\. Get a Wise account**. Sign up and add your first balance. You’ll be able to add more currencies afterwards. Please note that reviewing your application can take us a few days due to verification. 

Your account and all the currencies on it will be connected to the debit card. As long as you have enough money available in any currency in your balances, you should be able to use the card. 

**2\. Order your Wise card.** To order your card, click on the **Card** tab, and you’ll see an option to order the card.

We’ll check personal details, like your name and address. We also need to verify your account. 

In most cases, we'll ask you to pay a small fee for the card. In some cases, you will only need to add money to your balance. You will see what you need to do during the card order. Once everything looks right, we’ll ship the new card to you. 

What we check is slightly different in the US and Brazil — learn more about getting the card in the US and in Brazil

Australian customers — you can read our PDS/FSG to learn more.

 **If you ordered your card in the EEA, the UK, Australia, Singapore, Malaysia, Japan, Brazil or Canada** — you can check your card details before your card is delivered. Your card details are ready to be used for online purchases, and mobile wallet purchases.

 **3\. Activate your Wise card.** Once you receive your card, you need to activate it. 

If you have a US Mastercard, you can activate it by entering the 6-digit code. You’ll find it underneath your name on the front of your card. You can _enter it here_. 

If you're trying to activate your card in Japan, remember you may only be able to use it at one of these ATM providers: 

  * AEON 

  * E-net 

  * Daily Yamazaki




 **4\. All done!** Now you’ll be ready to spend almost anywhere in the world.
