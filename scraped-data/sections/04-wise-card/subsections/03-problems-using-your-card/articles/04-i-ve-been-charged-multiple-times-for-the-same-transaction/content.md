# Problems using your card  
## I've been charged multiple times for the same transaction?  
Seeing multiple charges for a single transaction can be worrying — but it doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll be charged multiple times. 

### Why do multiple charges happen?

Businesses might authorise multiple charges in error, or because of a technical problem.

In most cases, the money for duplicate transactions is sent back to your balance within a week. So it may be worth waiting.

### Check the status of your transaction

  1. Log in to your Wise account

  2. Go to **Home** to see your activity list

  3. Select the duplicate transaction(s) to check their status




### If all the transactions are pending

There’s nothing you need to do right now – you’ll have to wait for one of the transactions to go through. The money for the other pending transactions usually goes back to your account in 7 working days.

### If one of the transactions is completed, and the others are pending 

The money for the completed transaction has reached the business. The money for all the pending transactions will be automatically returned to your balance. This should happen within 7 days. There’s nothing you need to do.

### If all the transactions are completed, get in touch with the business you paid

The money for all these transactions is now with the business you paid. This means you’ll need to contact them and ask for a refund. If they don’t do this, you can ask for a refund through Wise’s dispute form.

If possible, send us the communication with them. It will help us build a stronger case for you.
