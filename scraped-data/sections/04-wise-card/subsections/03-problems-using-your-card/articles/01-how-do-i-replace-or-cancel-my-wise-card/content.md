# Problems using your card  
## How do I replace or cancel my Wise card?  
You can replace your Wise card at any time for a small fee.

On the app:

  1. Go to **Card** tab 

  2. Tap on **Replace Card**

  3. Choose the reason why are you replacing your card 

  4. Tap on **Replacement Card**




On the web:

  1. Click on **Cards** on the left-hand side

  2. Select **Replace card**

  3. Select one of the options on the screen




You’ll see 4 options:

  * I lost my card

  * My card was stolen

  * My card was damaged

  * Support team suggested I should




If you choose ‘’I lost my card’’ or ‘’My card was stolen’’, your card will be blocked and cancelled immediately and you’ll be able to order a new card.

If your card is damaged or our support team advised you to replace it, you can keep using your current card. It will be blocked and cancelled only when you activate your new one.

All you need to do is enter and confirm your delivery address, and your new card will be on its way.
