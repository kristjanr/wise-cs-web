# Problems using your card  
## Why doesn't contactless work for my Wise card?  
Contactless payments allow you to tap your card rather than providing a PIN or signature. They’re common in the UK, EEA, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Malaysia, Japan and Canada. They’re a safe way to make small payments, with secure encryption technology.

If contactless isn’t working with your Wise card, there are a few potential solutions.

 **1\. If you’ve never used contactless.** You need to use a card in an ATM or do a chip and PIN transaction one time before contactless can work.

 **2\. If you’ve used contactless already.** You’ve probably reached your spending limit. You can check or change your limit in the Wise app.

3\. If you got your card in the US and haven’t activated your card. You need to activate your card to make any kind of payments, including contactless. Once you get your card, go to the Cards section of your account and enter the 6-digit code that’s on the card under your name. Now it’s activated, you’ll need to do a chip and PIN transaction before using contactless.

4\. If you got your card in the US before 16th December 2019. Older versions of the Wise card in the US don’t work with contactless. But, if you have Apple Pay, Google Pay, or Samsung Pay, you can add your card and make contactless payments with your phone instead. US cards issued after 16th December 2019 will work with contactless.
