# Problems using your card  
## Why was my Wise card declined?  
If we have to decline your card payment, we'll tell you the reason — you can see it in your **Transactions.** And if you have push notifications or transaction emails turned on, we’ll tell you the reason there and then. You can manage your notifications in Settings.

We might not have this information when the merchant declines the payment and you'll only see that it wasn't successful. Just contact the merchant for more information about the decline reason. 

Here are some of the most common reasons your card can be declined:

### You’ve reached your spending limit

There are limits to the amount of money you can spend using your card, depending on the type of payment you’re making. 

You can check or increase your spending limits. Find out how below.

In the app:

  1. Tap on **Card**

  2. Select **Manage payment methods**

  3. Select **Account limits** to change or increase your spending limits




On the web: 

  1. Select **Cards**

  2. Select **Account limits** to change or increase your spending limits




### You’ve used the wrong billing address

When entering your Wise card details for online payments, be sure to enter the address you have listed on your Wise account. 

### Technical problems

There might have been some connectivity issues between us and the merchant. Try deleting your card details from their website, troubleshooting your browser, and make the payment again.

### It’s a type of transaction we don’t support

Sometimes our card isn't compatible with the merchant's payment platform — basically the way they might route the payment is in a way we don't allow. You might need to pay with a different card if this happens. 

Or, sometimes we’ll block a transaction for security reasons and we might not be able to tell you why. You might need to pay with a different card if this happens. 

### You’re trying to spend in a country your card won’t work

Unfortunately, you can’t use your debit card everywhere at the moment. Check which **countries you can’t use your card in**. 

### Your card’s frozen

You can quickly unfreeze it from the app by tapping on **Card** and then **Defrost**. Or you can unfreeze your card on our website. 

### You haven’t activated your card yet

You need to activate your card before you can start using it.
