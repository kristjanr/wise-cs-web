# Problems using your card  
## How do I get a refund if my digital card was replaced or deleted?  
Even if your card details were replaced or deleted, you can still receive a refund to your account.

If the merchant asks for the last four digits of the card, you can find this on the app*: 

  1. Go to **Home**

  2. Select the transaction you want the refund for

  3. Find the last 4 digits next to **Card ending in**




Once the merchant has sent your refund, it typically takes 5â€“10 working days for the money to arrive in your account.
