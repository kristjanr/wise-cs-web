# Problems using your card  
## I need to reverse a transaction  
Reversing a card transaction — sometimes called a ‘chargeback’ — is a process where you dispute a card transaction, and ask for a refund from the merchant. The ‘merchant’ in this case is usually a shop, retailer, or business.

 **How do I reverse a transaction on my Wise card?**

In most cases, you’ll need to get in touch with the merchant. But first, check the status of your transaction:

  1. Log in to your Wise app

  2. Go to **Home** to see your activity list

  3. Find the transaction you’d like to reverse — and tap/click to check its status




 **If it’s marked as Pending**

This means the money’s left your account, but we’re waiting for the merchant to claim it. 

We can’t reverse a transaction at this stage because we’re waiting on the merchant to make a decision — they may reverse the transaction or collect your money.

 **If it’s marked as Completed, get in touch with the merchant**

If the transaction’s completed, the merchant has claimed the money. So you’ll need to get in touch with them, preferably in writing, to ask for a refund. If they won’t cooperate, you can ask for a refund through our dispute form. This process is longer so it’s best to get in touch with the merchant first.

If you fill out our dispute form, we’ll ask you some required documentation to open a chargeback with Visa or MasterCard. The most commons are: the attempts of communication with the merchant and the receipt for the transaction.

We also need as many details as possible, like a detailed description of you purchased and what happened, including dates. It’s important to fill out the form with all the requested information and documentation to speed up the process, so we won’t need to request documentation by email.
