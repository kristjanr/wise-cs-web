## How do I use my NZD account details?  
### What are NZD account details?

These are your very own account details to receive New Zealand dollars (NZD) with zero fees.

This isn’t a bank account, but the account number we give you works in the same way when you’re receiving money. Just share your bank account number, along with the local address listed with your details to your friends, company or customers, and they can send you NZD from any New Zealand bank account. And no one pays any fees.

### How to receive NZD

First, you’ll need to get NZD account details. 

Then, share your details to the person who wants to pay you.

They can pay you by local bank transfer. They won’t be able to pay you using international wire or SWIFT.

Make sure your sender uses your complete account details when sending you money. Sometimes, banks may insist on three digit suffixes. If this is the case, simply add a 0 before the last 2 digits of your account number. For example, if your Wise account number is 11-2222-3333333-44 and the bank asks for a 3 digit suffix, use 11-2222-3333333-044 instead.

You can’t receive payments from outside New Zealand, or in currencies other than NZD.
