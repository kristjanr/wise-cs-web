## How do I use my GBP account details?  
### What are GBP account details?

These are your very own account details to receive British pounds (GBP) with zero fees. This isn’t a bank account, but the account number and sort code we give you work in the same way when receiving money. Just share your account name, number and sort code to your friends, company or customers, and they can send you GBP from any UK bank account. And no one pays any fees.

### How to receive GBP

First, you’ll need to get GBP account details.

Then, share your details to the person who wants to pay you.

They can pay using the Faster Payments System (FPS), Bacs or CHAPS. This can take up to 1 working day to arrive. 

They can also send you GBP by SWIFT. This can take 4–5 working days to arrive.

### Set up Direct Debits with your GBP account details

You can share your details with a company, and give them the permission to take regular payments from your account. 

You might use Direct Debits to pay for a monthly subscription like the gym, or to pay your phone or energy bill.
