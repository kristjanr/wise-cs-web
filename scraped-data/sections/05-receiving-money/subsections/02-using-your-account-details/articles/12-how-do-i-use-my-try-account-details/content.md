### What are TRY account details?

These are your very own account details to receive Turkish Lira (TRY) with zero fees.

The IBAN we give you works in the same way as any Turkish bank account when you’re receiving money. Just share your IBAN with your friends, company, or customers — and they can send you TRY from any Turkish bank account. 

You can receive individual payments of up to 1m TRY to your account details. There is no limit to how much you can hold in your balance though.

### How to receive TRY

First, you’ll need to get TRY account details.

Then, share your details with the person who wants to pay you. They can pay you by local bank transfer, but they can’t pay you using international wire (SWIFT). It usually takes 1 working day to receive TRY into your account.

### Payments from outside of Turkey 

You can’t receive payments from outside Turkey, or in currencies other than TRY.
