# Using your account details  
## How do I use my USD account details?  
### What are USD account details and how do I get them?

These are your very own account details to receive US dollars. Your USD account details can only receive USD.

Your account details include:

  * account name — your name as it appears on your Wise account

  * account number

  * routing number(s)

  * SWIFT code — for international payments from countries other than the US

  * local US address — if your payer needs to include an address, use: TransferWise, 30 W. 26th Street, Sixth Floor, New York, NY, 10010, United States. 




This isn’t a bank account, but the account number and routing number we give you work the same way when receiving money. Just share your account name and number, and routing number with your friends, company or customers, and they can send you USD from any US bank account.

When your sender enters your account details in their bank's system, they might see Community Federal Savings Bank (CFSB) if the routing number starts with 026, or Evolve Bank and Trust (EVOLVE) if the routing number starts with 084. This is because Wise's USD accounts are with both CFSB, and EVOLVE. 

Your sender's bank may ask for e-teller ID, but we won't have this information. When setting up the transfer, your sender should add your account details manually instead of selecting Evolve or CFSB from a list of available banks. 

If you have any questions about your account, always talk to Wise support team — CFSB or EVOLVE won’t be able to give you any information, because you don't have an account directly with them.

Check the limits for how much you can receive into your Wise USD balance.

### How do I receive USD from inside the US?

 **If your routing number starts with 084**

Your single routing number will work for both ACH and wire transfers.

 **If your routing number starts with 026**

Provide your ACH (ABA) routing number if you’re:

  * being paid a salary

  * receiving earnings from platforms, such as Amazon

  * receiving direct deposits

  * receiving non-urgent payments




ACH payments, also known as electronic money transfers, are the most common payment method in the US. They’re usually free, or cost a lower fee for your sender. They typically take 2–3 working days to reach Wise.

Provide your wire routing number if your sender specifically wants to pay you with a wire. Wire transfers can cost your sender 20–30 USD, but will reach your Wise account within 1 working day. If someone sends you money using a wire transfer, we’ll charge a 4.14 USD fee.

 **What if my sender used the wrong routing number?**

If your sender uses the wrong routing number, the money will bounce back to their account within 3 working days.

If the money hasn’t gotten back to them in that time, they should get in touch with their bank to set up a trace on the money.

 **Tip:** Check out our blog post all about different US payment methods. 

### How do I receive USD from outside the US?

Your USD account details can only receive USD — not other currencies. To receive other currencies you can get account details in another currency, or ask your sender to sign up with Wise.

You can't receive USD from outside the US if you live in one of these countries — this is because we can't give you a SWIFT code. 

If you have a SWIFT code, you can receive USD from anywhere in the world, except these countries and territories.

Your sender should go to their bank to set up a SWIFT transfer using your USD account details. This can take 4–5 working days to reach Wise.

Some banks will let your sender set up a SWIFT transfer online or through the phone, but they may need to go physically into the branch. When setting up the SWIFT transfer, they should choose **checking** as the account type.

If someone sends you money using a SWIFT transfer, we'll charge a 4.14 USD fee. 

**What information should my sender use?**

Provide your sender your:

  * account number

  * SWIFT/BIC code

  * the local address on your details: TransferWise, 30 W. 26th Street, Sixth Floor, New York, NY, 10010, United States




You can always check your details either on **Account details** in the app and browser, or by downloading a USD **account details document**. 

If your sender doesn’t provide the address in their SWIFT transfer, we’ll have to reject the payment. It can take 3–10 working days, sometimes longer, to get the money back to them.

### Set up Direct Debits with your USD account details
