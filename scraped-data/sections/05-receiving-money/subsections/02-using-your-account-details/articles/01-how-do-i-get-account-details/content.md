# Using your account details  
## How do I get account details?  
To get account details, you need to open a balance in one of the supported currencies. 

You can only open a balance if you live in a country where the Wise balance is available. 

Follow these steps to get account details:

  1. Go to **Home**

  2. Choose **Open**

  3. Select **Balance**

  4. Choose one of the currencies that has account details.

  5. Once you have the balance opened, click on **Receive** on the website, or **More** on the app.

  6. Select **Get account details**

  7. If it’s the first time you’re getting account details, you might need to complete some requirements first.




Once you’ve completed all of the requirements, you’ll have your own account details that can be shared with whoever wants to send you money — friends, companies, or customers.

### What are the requirements for my personal Wise account?

To get your first set of account details, we'll ask you to:

  * add 20 GBP to your account (or the equivalent in your currency)

  * verify your identity




If you're getting USD or EUR account details, you'll need to upload a photo of yourself holding your ID as part of verifying your identity. 

### What are the requirements for my Wise Business account?

 **For EEA, Switzerland and the UK:** you'll need to pay a 45 GBP (50 EUR) fee when signing up — this is a one-time onboarding fee. You won't be charged extra to open account details to receive money. 

**For other regions:** it's free to sign up, and the fee to open account details depends on where your business is registered. You can check our pricing page what fee we'll charge you — it can be 16-42 GBP (or equivalent in another currency). Some countries cost us more to verify you, so we might charge you a higher fee. You can only pay the fee using your debit/credit card, or from your balance. If you want to pay from a balance, you would first need to add money to your account.

After paying the fee, we’ll get started on verifying your business. Once verified, you’ll get your account details. If we can’t verify your business, we’ll refund the fee back to you. 

You only have to do these 2 steps for the first set of account details you get. After that, you can freely get account details for any of the other currencies that have them. 

All of your account details will also show in your **Manage** tab in the **Account details** section.
