# Using your account details  
## How do I use my EUR account details?  
### What are EUR account details?

These are your very own account details to receive euros (EUR) with zero fees.

This isn’t a bank account, but the IBAN and SWIFT/BIC code we give you work in the same way when receiving money. Just share your account name, IBAN and SWIFT/BIC code to your friends, company or customers, so they can send you EUR from their bank account.

Because we're licensed in Belgium, our IBAN starts with BE. We won't be able to provide IBAN with a different country code.

### How to receive EUR

First, you’ll need to get EUR account details.

Then, share your details to the person who wants to pay you.

They can pay using SEPA bank transfers or SWIFT.

SEPA bank transfers usually take 0–2 working days to arrive in your account. SWIFT transfers take 2–5 working days. 

**Receiving SWIFT**

If you're receiving EUR from outside the EU SEPA zone, the international payment will require correspondent bank details. Most banks will auto-generate this using the SWIFT database. If the person paying you needs routing information, use the following details:

  * Recipient SWIFT code/BIC: TRWIBEB1XXX

  * Correspondent SWIFT code/BIC: BARCGB22




You should only send EUR to these account details. If we receive payments to these EUR account details in any other currency, it'll get rejected and sent back to the sender.

But if the sending bank sends a SWIFT payment to us through another correspondent BIC (in another currency), the intermediary banks along the way might convert it to EUR — in this case, we can credit it to your EUR account. 

### Set up Direct Debits with your EUR account details 

You can share your details with a company, and give them the permission to take regular payments from your account. 

You might use Direct Debits to pay for a monthly subscription like the gym, or to pay your phone or energy bill.

### What if my EUR account details aren’t working?

 **I can’t set up a Direct Debit**

Your EUR account details support Direct Debits via the SEPA core direct debit scheme. We don’t support direct debits made via the SEPA B2B direct debit scheme.

 **A merchant is blocking my Direct Debit**

Despite the Euro single market, some merchants won’t allow Direct Debits from Euro accounts in another country. For example, a Spanish gym might not accept your IBAN because it’s based in Belgium.

Merchants are required by EU law to accept IBANs from other members of the European Economic Area (EEA). So, if someone doesn’t accept your IBAN, please let us know using this form. 

You can also report merchants who don’t accept your IBAN to the relevant authority in your country. 

**A bank isn’t recognising my Wise account details**

There are banks — particularly outside of Europe — who may not recognise your account details. If a bank won’t let you or someone who wants to pay you send money to your Wise account, there are 2 things you should do.

  1. Tell us by filling out this form

  2. Get in touch with our team — we'll send you a document you can give to the bank to help them understand what they need to do.
