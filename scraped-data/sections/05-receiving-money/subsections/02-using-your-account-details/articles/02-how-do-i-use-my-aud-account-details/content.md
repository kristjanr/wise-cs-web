## How do I use my AUD account details?  
### What are AUD account details?

These are your very own account details to receive Australian dollars (AUD) with zero fees.

This isn’t a bank account, but the account number and BSB code we give you work in the same way when receiving money. Just share your account name, number and BSB code, to your friends, company or customers, and they can send you AUD from any Australian bank account. And no one pays any fees.

### How to receive AUD

First, you’ll need to get AUD account details.

Then, share your details to the person who wants to pay you.

They can pay you by local bank transfer. They won’t be able to pay you using international wire or SWIFT.

It usually takes 1–2 working days to receive AUD into your account.

You won’t be able to receive RTGS payments, or transfers from Australian Superannuation Funds and Self Managed Superannuation Funds.

### Set up Direct Debits with your AUD account details

You can share your details with a company, and give them the permission to take regular payments from your account. 

You might use Direct Debits to pay for a monthly subscription like the gym, or to pay your phone or energy bill.
