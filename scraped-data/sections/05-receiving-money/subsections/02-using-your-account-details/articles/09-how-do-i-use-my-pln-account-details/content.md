### What are PLN account details?

These are your very own account details to receive Polish złoty (PLN) with zero fees.

This isn’t a bank account, but the account number we give you works in the same way when receiving money. Just share your account name and account number to your friends, company or customers, and they can send you PLN from any Polish bank account. And no one pays fees. 

Your account number is legally owned by Wise, and personally assigned to you, so you can receive money directly into your balance.

### How to receive PLN

Right now, you can’t get PLN account details if you don’t already have them. We stopped issuing account details for now, but will announce as soon as they are available again. If you already have the details, they’ll work as normal. 

Share your details to the person who wants to pay you. 

They can pay you by local bank transfer. They won’t be able to pay you using international wire or SWIFT, or by cash deposit at Poczta Polska. We also don’t accept split VAT payments. 

It usually takes 1–2 working days to receive PLN into your account. We don’t currently support instant transfers to your PLN account details.

### Payments from outside Poland

You can’t receive payments from outside Poland, or in currencies other than PLN.
