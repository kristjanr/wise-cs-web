### What are RON account details?

These are your very own account details to receive Romanian leu (RON) with zero fees.

This isn’t a bank account, but the account details we give you works the same way when you’re receiving money. Just share your details with your friends, company or customers, and they can send you RON from any Romanian bank account. And no one pays any fees.
