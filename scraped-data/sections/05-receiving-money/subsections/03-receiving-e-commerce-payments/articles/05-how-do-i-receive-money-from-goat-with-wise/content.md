# Receiving e-commerce payments  
## How do I receive money from GOAT with Wise?  
GOAT is a platform where individuals and businesses can list and sell authentic sneakers, apparel, and accessories. 

GOAT app users can use their Wise account to receive payments from GOAT in USD.

As a seller, you can only set and manage your seller account on the GOAT app. 

GOAT operates in USD, so all fees are listed in USD. But you can transact in any of the 11 currencies listed on their app. GOAT will always first convert from USD to your preferred currency at their defined exchange rate and conversion fee. Learn more about _GOAT’s exchange rates_ and their _fee policy_ **.**

If you reside in a country outside the US, we recommend using your Wise account to receive USD from GOAT — it’ll help you save on conversion fees. When you receive the USD, you can use Wise to _convert to your preferred currency_ and _withdraw to your local bank account_.
