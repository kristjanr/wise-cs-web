# Receiving e-commerce payments  
## How do I receive money from Amazon with Wise?  
If you sell on multiple Amazon marketplaces, you can withdraw your different currency earnings directly into your Wise account. This way, you’ll avoid paying high currency conversion fees.

Wise account details are compatible with Amazon US, Amazon Europe, Amazon UK and Amazon Australia. 

Here’s how you can set up your Wise account details to receive local currency payments from your various Amazon seller accounts.

### Non-US Residents using Amazon US Marketplace

If you’re not a US resident, Amazon will ask for tax verification. Sign the document stating that you're a non-US citizen and not a taxpayer there. Your payments and new product postings will stay pending until you sign it and send it back to Amazon.
