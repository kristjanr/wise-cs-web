### What do I do if my Wise account is blocked?

A common reason for blocked accounts on Stripe is that people make typos in the account details they try to link. When entering your Wise account details, always double-check these are correct. If you get these wrong, get in touch with Stripe and have the correct details ready so they can help fix the problem.

Another reason is if you go into a negative balance in Stripe because of refunds or disputes. If this happens, Stripe will automatically try to make a direct debit from the linked account (in this case — Wise) to make the refund. This won’t work for NZD, or USD if you have account details with a routing number starting with "026". 

Get in touch with Stripe if this happens, and they’ll help you arrange another way of clearing the negative balance.
