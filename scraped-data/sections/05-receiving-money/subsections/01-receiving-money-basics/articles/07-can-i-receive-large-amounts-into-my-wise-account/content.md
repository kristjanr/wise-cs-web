# Receiving money basics  
## Can I receive large amounts into my Wise account?  
Yes, you can receive large amounts into any balance with account details. But there are a couple of things you should know beforehand. 

### We may ask you for more information

If you’re receiving a large amount of money, we may need to ask you about your relationship with the sender, or the purpose of the payment. This is a regulatory requirement for us, and it helps us to make sure that our services are safe for everyone.

### There are limits for USD balances when receiving money

For most currencies, you can receive money on your balance without a limit. 

If your USD account details have a routing number starting with 026, then the following limits apply.
