## How do I request money?  
Creating a payment request is free and easy with Wise. Our payment request feature is available once you’ve opened a balance and have account details enabled. 

### **Here’s how to request money:**

You need to log in to your Wise personal or business account first. Once you're logged in, there are two ways you can set up a payment request.

 **On your Wise balance**

  1. Select the currency you'd like to request the payment in. You have to have account details for this feature to work. 

  2. On the website, click on **Request**. On the app, click on **More,** then **Request a payment**.

  3. Fill out the amount and click on **Create payment link.** You’ll be able to share your payment link with your company, clients, family or friends. 




**From the Manage tab**

  1. Select **Manage** from the main navigation menu. 

  2. If you’re a web user, select **Payment requests**. If you’re on the app, select **Requested payments**. 

  3. On the web, click **Request a payment.** On the app, click on **New.**

  4. Fill out the amount, select the currency and click on **Create payment link.** You’ll be able to share your payment link with your company, clients, family or friends. 




Once paid, you’ll receive the payment directly into the account balance of the currency you requested.
