# Receiving money basics  
## Do I need to do anything before receiving a large amount?  
You don’t need to do anything, like send us documents, before you receive a large amount of money. As we review transfers on a case by case basis, there’s no way to know what information we’ll need until we’ve got the money from the sender. 

Sometimes, we’ll ask you about your relationship to the sender, where they got their money, and the purpose of the transfer. This is a regulatory requirement for us, and it helps us to make sure that our services are safe for everyone.
