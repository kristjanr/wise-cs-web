### How limits work for USD account details

 **For account details with a routing number starting with 026**


--- CSV table begins ---  
,Personal limit,Business limit  
"USD limit, per transaction and per day","20,000,000 USD","30,000,000 USD"  
USD limit per year*,"35,000,000 USD","50,000,000 USD"  
--- CSV table ends ---  


Any money you receive into your USD balance using your USD account details — either by someone else or yourself — will count towards the limit.

There are no limits if you choose **Add USD** , or convert money from one of your other balances into your USD balance.

*These limits apply for a rolling 365-day period, and not per calendar year. So, say you receive a payment on 10 April — this will count towards your limit until 11 April the following year. 

**For account details with a routing number starting with 084**

There are no limits to receive, add, convert, or hold money in your USD account.
