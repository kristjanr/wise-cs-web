Check the latest fees for receiving money.

 **Fees when receiving USD**

Receiving US dollars, domestic or SWIFT wires, to your account details, will cost you 4.14 USD per transaction. 

When you receive a wire transfer to your account details, we’ll take 4.14 USD off the amount received from the sender. For example, if you’re sent 1,000 USD, we’ll take off 4.14 USD and add 995.86 USD to your USD account.

There’s no fee to receive ACH payments, or any other kind of payment that uses your ACH routing number.

 **Other fees**

The sender’s bank may charge fees before it reaches us, so it might be worth getting the sender to check with them.

You can receive a large amount for free, but check our list of holding and receiving fees. Note that we charge fees for holding large AUD amounts if you live in Australia.
