# Receiving money basics  
## How do I receive money?  
Receiving money into your account works just like a regular bank account. Just share the account details of the currency you want to be paid to the person or business who wants to pay you. 

You can get account details in USD, GBP, EUR, AUD*, NZD, CAD, HUF, RON**, TRY and SGD — with more currencies on the way. You can get paid in the same currency as your balance, so to get GBP, share your GBP account details.

*Australian customers — learn more about PDS/FSG.

**RON account details are only available for residents of the EEA, Switzerland, the US, Canada, Australia, and Japan.

### Here’s how to receive money:

  1. Open a currency account in the currency you want to receive money in. You can do this from **Home** in the website or app. 

  2. Click **Get account details** — you’ll need to complete some requirements if it’s the first time you’re getting account details.

  3. Share these account details to your company, clients or friends, so they can send you money using them.

  4. You’ll receive their payment directly into that currency account in your account.




Some things to note:

  * You can only receive payments in the same currency as your account. So, if you want to be paid in AUD, share your AUD account details to the person paying you. If they try to pay a different currency into your currency account, we’ll reject the payment.

  * You can instantly convert the money to other currencies once it’s in your currency accounts.

  * There are no fees to receive payments using your account details, with the exception of receiving US dollars domestic or SWIFT wires that cost $4.14 per transaction.

  * There’s no limit for how much you can receive to your different currency accounts right now, with the exception of US dollars.

  * Wise doesn’t accept cash or cheque payments. Read more about which types of transfers you can receive.

  * You can convert the money to other currencies once it’s in your currency accounts.

  * You can’t get PLN account details right now. We need to make some improvements to our PLN account details. So, we’ve had to stop users getting these details for the time being. If you already have PLN account details, you can keep using them as normal.

  * In August 2020, we replaced our old EUR account details for new ones that start with **BE**. How the new EUR account details might affect you.
