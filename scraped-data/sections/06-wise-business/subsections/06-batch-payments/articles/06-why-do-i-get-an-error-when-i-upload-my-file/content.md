# Batch payments  
## Why do I get an error when I upload my file?  
If you receive an error message after you upload your batch payment file, we’ll show you which transfers have errors and why on screen at the “Review Transfers” step.

You can download “a copy of these errors” to fix those transfers later and continue with the rest. Alternatively, you can fix the errors within the file and reupload it.

If you still get error messages on your new file, please email us the output file with the error messages. 

Common errors include: 

  * Your file is not in a .CSV or .XLSX format

  * Your file size is larger than 5MB

  * The file contains more than one source currency

  * There are more than 1,000 transfers or recipients in your batch file

  * Header row column names have been changed

  * You may have used special characters or punctuation

  * Necessary fields are left blank
