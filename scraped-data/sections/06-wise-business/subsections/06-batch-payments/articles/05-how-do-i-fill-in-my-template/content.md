# Batch payments  
## How do I fill in my template?  
If you select “Send by email” and “Send to saved recipients”, you can download the template straightaway and open the CSV template file with a spreadsheet app like Microsoft Excel or Numbers and start filling it out.

For the “Send to bank accounts” template, you’ll be able to pre-fill some information about recipients (e.g. their currency, country, amount, etc.) in our template builder. You’ll still need to download and fill out the rest of the template by hand (only the boxes that start with “e.g.” need to be filled out). “E-mail” and “Payment reference” are optional, so they could be left blank.

The first row in the spreadsheet contains all the headers that tell you what should be in each column. Make sure to leave the column headers unchanged.

Each following row in the spreadsheet will represent one transfer. You can add up to 1,000 transfers per batch file.

Each file can contain multiple recipient currencies but only one source currency (the currency that you’ll be funding the Batch with).

Save and upload your file to your account page as a .CSV or .XLSX file.
