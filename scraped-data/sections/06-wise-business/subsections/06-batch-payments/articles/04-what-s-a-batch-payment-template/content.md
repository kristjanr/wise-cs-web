# Batch payments  
## What's a batch payment template?  
We’ve created different templates to help you get started with batch payments. They’re downloadable in .CSV (comma separated value) format files that you can open using a spreadsheet app, like Microsoft Excel. or Numbers. There are multiple to choose from: 

  * _Send by email_ (if you don’t know the recipient’s bank details)

  * Send to saved recipients (download the list of all saved recipients)

  * Send to bank accounts (send to new recipients)




You can save and upload your batch file as a .CSV or .XLSX file.
