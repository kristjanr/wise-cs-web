# Batch payments  
## Guide to batch payments  
The batch payment tool is free - it _ ****_ allows you to create and send multiple payments in one go by simply uploading a file. You can then make a single transfer to Wise to cover all payments in the batch. Some people may call a batch payment a bulk payment, mass payout, or mass payment. 

Batch payments are the perfect solution for businesses that need to make a large number of payouts to their customers, freelancers, employees, investors, or suppliers around the world. The main benefit of using the batch payment tool is being able to create up to 1,000 transfers with a single .CSV or .XLSX file rather than setting up one transfer at a time.
