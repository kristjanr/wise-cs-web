# Batch payments  
## How do I pay for my batch?  
At the final step of the batch payment, you’ll be able to pay for your transfer. You’ll see two payment options: **pay by local bank transfer** , and **use balances already in your Wise Business account**. 

For **Option 1** , we’ll give you our bank details, and you can send the total amount of your batch to us via bank transfer. Once you have sent your bank transfer, mark your batch payment as paid by clicking **I have paid**. When we've received the money, we’ll pay out the correct amounts to each of your recipients.

For **Option 2** , you’ll be able to select **pay from one of your Wise Business balances**.

Keep in mind: there's a fee for each transfer — we’ll sum up all the fees for all the transfers in the batch, and show you the total fee.
