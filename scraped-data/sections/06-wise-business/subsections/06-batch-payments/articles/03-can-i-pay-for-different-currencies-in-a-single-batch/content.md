# Batch payments  
## Can I pay for different currencies in a single batch?  
Yes, you can pay out to multiple currencies when using batch payments. Once you’ve selected the “Send to bank accounts” template, you can choose the recipient's currency and we’ll update the required fields based on that currency.

When you click on “Add Row”, in our template builder, you’ll see the template with column headings reflecting the required fields. Pick another currency from the dropdown menu and add another row to add those fields to the template, too. You can keep adding more rows for as many currencies as you need.
