# Inviting and managing team members  
## Can I transfer my business account to someone else?  
You can leave your Wise Business account, and transfer it to another Admin user any time. 

Once you transfer ownership of an account, your access is fully cancelled. This means, you can’t log in anymore, and your business Wise cards will be blocked. 

You can be invited as a user by the new Owner or another Admin anytime. 

You can only change ownership on our website, to do this:

  1. Go to **Manage**

  2. Under **Business tools** , select **Team**

  3. Select your name, and **Change owner**

  4. If you don’t have any eligible Admins listed, we’ll give you the option to **Add an Admin** first

  5. From your list of Admins, choose the new owner

  6. Select **Continue**

  7. Confirm the change, by selecting **Continue and leave account**
