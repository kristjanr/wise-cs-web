# Inviting and managing team members  
## Assigning roles to your team  
Multi-user Access (MUA) lets your team have different levels of access to your Wise business account. 

You can give the following roles to team members on your Wise business account:

  * Viewer — can view the account, connect to accounting software, and download statements.

  * Employee — can spend with their own Wise business card(s) up to pre-set limits, and view their own activity.

  * Preparer — can set up single payments for approval, view the account, and download statements.

  * Payer — can make and manage payments, convert between balances, and download statements.

  * Admin — can view and manage everything, add and remove team members, and spend with business card(s). 




Team members can only access the **business account** (s) you invited them to. They can’t access your personal account. 

Admins and Employees can have their own Wise business card in supported countries. You can simply transfer ownership of your Wise business account to another Admin.

### What can Viewers do?

Viewers can:

  * see all account activity

  * download statements

  * download receipts

  * manage accounting bank feeds




Viewers can’t do anything else — like make payments, or manage users or recipients.

This role lets you give your accountant, or anyone else who needs to do reporting for your business, access to your transactions.

### What can Employees do?

Employees can get their own Wise business card, but they don’t have access to the business details or activity. They can’t do anything else — like make payments, or manage users or recipients.

This role is perfect for corporate buyers, or for the purpose of petty cash.

### What can Preparers do?

Preparers can set up single payments of any amount that require approval from an Admin. This role gives Admins more control over payments.

Preparers can:

  * set up transfer orders

  * see all account activity

  * download statements

  * download receipts

  * manage accounting bank feeds

  * contact Customer Support for general advice

  * manage recipients




### What can Payers do?

Payers can:

  * make and manage payments

  * manage accounting software feeds

  * convert balances

  * see all account activity

  * download statements




Payers have less authority on the business account than Admins. They can contact Customer Support on behalf of the business, but they can't manage members, get their own Wise business debit card, or open or close a balance.

This role is best suited for financial managers, or for anyone that needs to manage payments for the business. 

### What can Admins do?

Admins are authorised to do anything that the Account Owner can do. This role lets those with full authority represent your business manage the business account.

###  **Custom Roles**

Custom Roles is a feature which allows Admins and Owners to mix and match access and permissions for other team members.

To add a Custom Role, follow these steps:

  1. Go to the **Team tab**.

  2. Select **Roles**.

  3. Click on **Create role**. You’ll see the option to add a role name (for example “HR Department”) and a short description.

  4. Toggle to select accesses for this role. You can choose from these categories: _Payments and Receipts, Balances, Integrations, Cards, Team Management._

  5. Assign an existing user to this role or set it up later — that’s it!




To edit a Custom Role:

  1. Go to the **Team** tab.

  2. Scroll down and edit the role by clicking on the three dots next to the role name. You can also assign this role to another team member. 




If you want to delete a Custom Role, make sure to reassign your team members to another role first.
