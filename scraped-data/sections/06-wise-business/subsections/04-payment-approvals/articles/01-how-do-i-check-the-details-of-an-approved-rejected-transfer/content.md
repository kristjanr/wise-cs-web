# Payment Approvals  
## How do I check the details of an approved/rejected transfer?  
Transfers that have been set up and are awaiting approval will appear in the **Needs your attention** section on the top of the Home page. After a transfer is approved/ rejected, it will appear amongst your other transfers in the Activity feed.

### How do I know who approved/ rejected a transfer?

You can check who approved or rejected a transfer by selecting the transfer and viewing its **transfer details** on the website. 

If you set up the transfer, you’ll also be notified via email when it’s been approved or rejected. Please ensure you have **Transfer and balances** email notifications turned on to receive these emails. 

_Manage your notifications_ (under Notifications > Transfers and balances)

### Why was the transfer rejected?

If the team member that rejected a payment left a **Rejection reason,** you can find it under the transfer’s details section. If no Rejection reason is stated, try checking with the team member that rejected the payment for more information.
