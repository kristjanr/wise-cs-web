# Payment Approvals  
## How do I approve/reject a payment requiring approval?  
Currently, only Admins can approve or reject payments. 

On the website or mobile app:

  1. Select the transfer that requires approval. It will appear under the **Needs your attention** section on the top of the Home page.

  2. Select **Approve** to continue with the payment, or **Reject** to cancel it.




Once approved, youâ€™ll be taken to pay for the transfer. If you reject the payment, you may also leave a **Rejection reason** , which will be sent to the team member who set the payment up.
