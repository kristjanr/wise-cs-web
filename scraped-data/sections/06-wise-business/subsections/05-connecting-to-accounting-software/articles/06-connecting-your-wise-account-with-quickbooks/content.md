## Connecting your Wise account with QuickBooks  
To connect your Wise account with your QuickBooks account:

  1. Log in to your QuickBooks account

  2. Go to the **Banking** tab

  3. Click **Add Account** in the top right corner

  4. Search for Wise. You might find more than one option for different countries. They should all work, but you can choose the one of the country your business is registered in

  5. Log in to your Wise account

  6. Choose the account you want to connect to QuickBooks

  7. Choose the balances you want to connect to QuickBooks — it’ll default to the currency of the country you chose in step 4, but you can change this

  8. Choose the date you want QuickBooks to pull transactions from

  9. Click **Connect**




The authorisation to share your data with QuickBooks will expire after 90 days. You’ll need to authorise sharing your data again at this point.

You won't be able to connect your Wise account if your subscription level with QuickBooks doesn't allow this connection. 

### Bills feature 

To set up the Bills feature, you can either search for Wise in the QuickBooks App Store, or turn the Bills feature on through the Wise App Marketplace. All unpaid bills will then sync to Wise.
