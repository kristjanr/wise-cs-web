## How do I sync my Wise transactions to Xero?  
Once you’ve _connected your Wise and Xero accounts_, head to your _Connection settings_ and make sure the ‘ ** _Bank feeds sync_** ’ feature is switched on. 

On this page, go to _Advanced settings_ to change which currencies you automatically want synced to Xero. 

Any Wise transaction for the balances you choose will appear in your Xero bank accounts of the same currency.
