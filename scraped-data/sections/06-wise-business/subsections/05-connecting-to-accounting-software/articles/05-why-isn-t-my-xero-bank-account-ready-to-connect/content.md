# Connecting to accounting software  
## Why isn't my Xero bank account ready to connect?  
If you see the error message “ **This bank account isn’t ready to connect with Wise** ,” it means the Xero bank account you’ve chosen to connect a balance with hasn’t been configured correctly in Xero. Often, it’s because it’s already been set up to support another bank or platform. 

You have three options:

  1.  **Edit the chosen bank account** in Xero to make sure it’s configured correctly. Then try again. You can follow the instructions below.

  2.  **Create a new Xero bank account** to connect to this balance. You can do this without leaving Wise. Go to **Advanced settings** from your _Connection settings_ and choose **Create a new account** from the dropdown, next to the balance you’d like to connect it to. Enter a new name and click **Save**.

  3.  **Choose another Xero bank account of the same currency.** Go to **Advanced settings** from your _Connection settings_ and choose from the dropdown, next to the balance you’d like to connect it to and click **Save**.

### Editing your chosen Xero bank account

It’s easy to edit your Xero bank account so it can connect with Wise. You just need to make sure Wise is listed as the bank you’d like to use. 

  1. First, log into Xero and follow the below instructions to edit your chosen bank account

  2. In the **Accounting** menu, select **Bank Accounts.**

  3. Next to the bank account you want to connect to Wise, select **Manage Account** , then **Edit Account Details.**

  5. Now go back to your Wise Business account **Home.**

  6. Select one of the balances and select the overflow menu ( **...** ).

  7. Select **Manage Accounting.**

  8. Try connecting the balance again to the edited Xero bank account.
