### We’re 14x cheaper than PayPal

Banks and services like PayPal often set their own, unfriendly exchange rates. This means you pay more than you need to when you send, spend, or receive money internationally. And they pocket the difference. 

At Wise, we never mark up the exchange rate. You always will get the real mid-market exchange rate – like you’d find on independent sources like Google, XE, Yahoo Finance or Reuters. Our customers are already saving over £3 million every day.
