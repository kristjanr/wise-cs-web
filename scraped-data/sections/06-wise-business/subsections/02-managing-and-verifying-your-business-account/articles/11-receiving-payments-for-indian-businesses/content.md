# Managing and verifying your business account  
## Receiving payments for Indian businesses  
Your international clients can send money to your Indian business using your **account details** with Wise. 

## What are account details?

These are your very own account details to receive money in currencies like USD, GBP or EUR with zero fees. It isn’t a bank account, but the details work the same way when receiving money. Just share your account name and details to your clients, so they can send you the amount from their bank account, or using Wise.

## How to receive money

  1.  **Sign up for a Wise Business account** and fill in the necessary details about your business

  2.  **Choose the currencies** you would want to have account details for and finish the verification steps

  3. Share your account details with your clients

  4. Clients can pay using Wise or their bank details

  5. After the payment is received in your account, you would receive a **self service notification** where you would have to provide us the invoice and client details

  6. After the self service is resolved, we will **automatically convert the money into INR** and transfer it to your verified Indian bank account that you provided during verification

  7. You will receive the payment to your INR bank account within **1-2 days**

  8. You will also receive the e-FIRC for the transfer to your email address within **7 days**




**Keep in mind:**

  * Bank transfers from your clients using the local payment methods usually take 0–2 working days to arrive in your account. International SWIFT transfers take 2–5 working days.

  * We charge you an equivalent of 2.50 USD in the requested currency for the transfer to your INR bank account. 




## How much can I receive? 

Based on our regulations, the maximum amount you can receive in your account details is 10,000 USD per transaction. If the transferred amount exceeds this limit, it will be returned to the sender.

## Self service resolution time

You need to provide us the payer and invoice details within **7 days** from our notification. If the self service isn't resolved within this time, we will return the money to the sender.
