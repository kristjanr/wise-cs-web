# Managing and verifying your business account  
## Why do I need to verify my business?  
Verification is one of the ways we keep your business’s money safe, and comply with the financial regulations in the countries that we operate in. 

That’s why, when you open a business account, we may ask you for a few documents or to confirm your details on a business registry. This helps us verify who you are, that your business is currently trading, and it meets our acceptable use policy. Think of it like opening a bank account — except that with Wise you can do the whole thing online, quickly and easily.
