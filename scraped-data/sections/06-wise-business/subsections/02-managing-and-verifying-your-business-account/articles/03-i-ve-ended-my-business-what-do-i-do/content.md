# Managing and verifying your business account  
## I've ended my business, what do I do?  
Ending your business can be stressful. But we’ve made it easier to get your Wise Business account sorted when this happens.

If your business has entered the insolvency or liquidation proceeding, share our email thirdpartyrequests@wise.com with your liquidator or the insolvency administrator.

When they reach out to our team, we’ll act in accordance with their instructions. Your Wise Business account will be deactivated and the remaining funds will be transferred to the details specified by your liquidator or insolvency administrator.

If you’re planning to end your business soon, you can reach out to thirdpartyrequests@wise.com with any questions.
