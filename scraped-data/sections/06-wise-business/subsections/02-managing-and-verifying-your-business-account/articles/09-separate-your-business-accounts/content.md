# Managing and verifying your business account  
## Separate your business accounts  
If you'd like to separate your business accounts, we'd first recommend changing the email address from your business one to your personal one.

After you've done that, you'll be free to use the same business email address when moving the business to a new account.

To separate your business account from the current login details, all you need to do is:

  1. Log into your business account

  2. Go to **Manage** on the left-hand panel

  3. Go on **Team** under **Business tools**

  4. Choose **Add team members** at the top

  5. Invite your business email as an Admin user

  6. Accept the invite from the email invitation and set up the new account

  7. Go back to your current business account, then **Team** again

  8. Click on your **name** , then **Change owner**

  9. Choose the **Admin** to be the new **Owner** and confirm the change




Once youâ€™ve followed those steps, your business account has been moved to separate login details from your current account.
