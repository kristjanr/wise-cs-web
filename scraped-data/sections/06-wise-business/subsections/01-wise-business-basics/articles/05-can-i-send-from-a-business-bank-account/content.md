# Wise Business basics  
## Can I send from a business bank account?  
Yes, as long as you have a Wise Business account. Unfortunately, we can’t accept payments from business bank accounts if you only have a personal Wise account. 

**Tip:** Open a Wise Business account to send money from business bank accounts.

 **I’ve already sent money from a business bank account**

If you’ve already sent money from a business bank account and you don’t have a Wise Business account — or you’ve accidentally used your personal Wise account — here’s what you can do. 

**If you accidentally used your personal Wise account instead of your Wise Business account — don’t worry**

If you already have a Wise Business account, but accidentally used your personal Wise account to set up your transfer, you don’t need to do anything. 

We can normally fix this ourselves, and send your money anyway. It’s rare that we’d need more information from you. But if we do, we’ll get in touch via email.

 **If you used a personal Wise account and you don’t have a Wise Business account, we can’t process your payment**

The easiest way to fix this is to cancel the transfer yourself. Then, open a Wise Business account and restart your transfer. Verifying a new account can take 4-7 business days, so your transfer will take longer.

 **Tip:** Whether you can cancel your transfer depends on how far along it is in our system. To see what stage it’s at, track the transfer in your account. From there, match the status of your transfer to the correct heading below before reading on.

 **If you’ve set up a transfer or your money’s on its way to us, you can cancel yourself**

You may see a different message for this step, like ‘Your money may still be in your bank account’, or ‘Sorry, we didn’t get the money yet’. This is fine — you should still be able to cancel, and we’ll refund the money. ****

**Tip:** Learn how to cancel your transfer

 **If your money’s being processed, we’ll email you**

At this point, the money’s reached Wise, and you can’t cancel the transfer yourself. We’ll stop the transfer and get in touch with you. 

Please look out for an email from Wise. It’ll ask whether you’d like to:

  * Tell us this is a business transfer and set up a Wise Business account to continue.

  * Or cancel your transfer and get a refund.




 **Tip:** This email is sent automatically — so it may be faster and smoother to fix this over email, than it is to get in touch with us.
