# Wise Business basics  
## Can I have more than one business account?  
If you run multiple businesses, you can have Wise accounts for each one. All of your accounts can live under one set of login details. 

To set up additional business accounts:

  1. Go to your Wise account, and select your name in the top right corner

  2. Select **Switch account**

  3. Choose **Get a business account** and follow on-screen instructions




You can only have one account per business, or entity.
