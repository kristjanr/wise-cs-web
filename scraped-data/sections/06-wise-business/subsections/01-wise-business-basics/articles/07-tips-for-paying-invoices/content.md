### Sending an exact amount

There are 2 ways to send an exact amount with Wise.

1\. With our guaranteed rate feature. As long as we receive your money within a specified amount of time, then the rate you saw when creating the transfer is the rate you’ll get.

  1. Amount lock transfer. Enter the amount you want your recipient to receive, and click the lock icon in the ’Recipient gets’ box.




We then take an extra 3% on top of your deposit to cover any rate changes while we’re converting your money. As soon as we pay it out, we pay you back any of that 3% that we didn’t use during conversion and your recipient receives the exact amount you specified.
