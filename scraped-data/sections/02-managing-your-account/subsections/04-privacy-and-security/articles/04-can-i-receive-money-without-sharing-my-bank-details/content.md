## Can I receive money without sharing my bank details?  
If the **Contacts on Wise** feature is enabled, other people who know you can sync their contacts and you’ll show up in their **Recipients**. This is only possible for personal account holders. 

They can also send money with only your email address. This is possible for both personal and business accounts.

  * If you’ve marked a primary account, we’ll show them the account you want to receive money into

  * If **Contacts** on Wise is enabled, we’ll find a match to your Wise account — just make sure you have a balance to receive money into first

### What do we do with the information from your phone’s contacts?

We never send or store your full phone’s contacts on our servers. We also never get in touch with your contacts. We only use this information to make it easier to send money between you and your friends.

Bear in mind that when you switch the feature on, any Wise customer with your phone number or email address will see your account name and photo on their app but rest assured that they will not be able to see any of your account numbers.
