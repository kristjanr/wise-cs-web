# Privacy and security  
## What do you do with my information?  
We store your information securely, as it needs to be recorded in compliance with our regulators. This data is not passed on to third parties unless it is vital to your use of Wise (for example passing on information to our partner bank in order to complete a transfer), as required by law, or consented to as outlined in our privacy policy.

We’ll also occasionally send our own emails about new products or currencies we’re releasing that may be of interest to you. If you don’t want to receive these, you can manage your notification settings here.

We can’t delete your information, because we have to keep records of users as a regulated financial institution. But we can deactivate your account if you no longer want to use it.

You can read our full privacy policy if you’d like more information.
