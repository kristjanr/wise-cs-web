### I didn’t get the password reset email

If you didn’t get the email; here are a few of the most common reasons why, and what to do to fix it.

  *  **You didn’t provide the right email.** Try again with the one you use for Wise. 

  * **You spelt your email wrong.** Double check for any typos and fix them before trying again.

  *  **The email’s in a different inbox.** Make sure you check the right email inbox you provided, as well as the spam folder.




### I signed up using a social login

If you signed up to Wise using Google, Facebook, or your Apple ID, you’ll need to set a separate password for confirming activity (like sending money from your balances).

If you don’t want to use your social login anymore, you can switch to using an email and password instead. If you’re logged in, go to Settings to disconnect from your social login. If you log out without setting password afterward, you will need to select **Forgot password** on the login page and follow the steps to set a new one.
