# Logging in  
## Can I sign up with my Facebook, Google, or Apple account?  
Yes, when you’re signing up, you can choose to connect with your Facebook, Google, or Apple account. You’ll be taken to a separate page to confirm which account you want to sign up with, and that you’re happy for us to receive the specified information.

When you sign up through Facebook, Google or Apple, you may be asked to enter your Wise password to confirm activities such as sending money from your balances, or revealing your PIN. 

If you can’t remember your Wise password or have never made one:

  1. Click **Forgot password**

  2. Enter your email address and click the **Send password reset link**

  3. Follow the steps in the email we send you




Depending on which country you live in, we may also ask for your Wise password when you log in through Facebook, Google, or Apple. 

Note: if your address is in Turkey, you won’t be able to use Facebook, Google, or Apple to sign up, due to local regulations.
