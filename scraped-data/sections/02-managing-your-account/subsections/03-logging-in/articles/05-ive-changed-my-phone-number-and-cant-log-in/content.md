When you change your number using the link above, we'll ask for:

  * A selfie with ID

  * Your new number — we’ll send you an SMS to verify it




It takes between 1–2 working days to review the request — we’ll let you know once it’s done. And if we need any more information, we’ll get in touch.

 **If you run into trouble uploading your selfie with ID** , you can email it to us as an attachment along with your new phone number (and country code).
