# Setting up and managing your account  
## Guide to getting verified  
When you open a bank account, you usually need to take some ID into the bank branch. Wise is no different. We’re a financial institution, so we need to know who’s using our service. It helps us combat money laundering, and keep everyone’s money safe. 

So depending on where you’re sending money from, and how much you send, we’ll ask you to verify your identity. This helps us keep your money safe.

If you have a Wise Business account, we also need to verify information about your business.

### How does verification work?

We usually verify your identity with some photo ID, proof of address, and/or a picture of you holding your ID.

When and how we verify you depends on a few things:

  *  **The amount you send**

    * When you send larger amounts, we might need to see additional documents that show how you got the money.

    * When you send smaller amounts, we’ll usually verify your identity.

  *  **The currency you send**

    * Some countries require proof of identity to send any amount.

    * Some currencies require further identification. For example, sending US dollars requires an online banking log in.

    * Some countries and currencies require more information about how you earn your money, and how you plan to use Wise. If we need this, we’ll ask you when you set up your transfer.

  *  **How many transfers you’ve made**

    * While we might only verify your identity at first, we might need to verify your address later on.




Sometimes, we need to ask for additional documents once a transfer has started. Rest assured our team will work tirelessly to verify these documents as soon as possible to get your money moving again.

Other times, we can automatically verify you when you make a bank transfer. If your transfer comes from your own bank account, and your name there matches with the name on your Wise account, we consider this a first form of identity confirmation. You may not need to do ID or address verification in this situation. 

We can only do this for some currencies, and if you send below 15,000 EUR. We can’t do this for business accounts, either.

### What types of documents does Wise accept?

Everything on the document you share should match the information on your Wise account. 

Make sure the photo isn’t blurry or covered, so we can see all the info. If there’s information on the back of your document, we’ll need to see that, too. 

Make sure the document isn’t in Arabic, Aramaic, Azerbaijani, Hebrew or Urdu text — we don’t have the resources to support these. 

**A** **valid ID** **can be:**

  * Passport (photo page only)

  * National ID card (we only accept the most recent version of the Nigerian national ID card)

  * Photo driving licence (there are some _exceptions_)




 **A valid** **proof of address document** **can be:**

  * Utility bills: gas, electric, or landline phone (no mobile phone bills)

  * A bank or credit card statement (photo/scan of a physical letter or PDF of statement)

  * A council tax bill, or a HMRC notification

  * Vehicle registration or tax

  * Photo driving licence showing your address and expiry date

  * Any other government or financial institution-issued document

### How does live ID + Selfie verification work?

In some cases you may be asked to capture a picture of your ID and a selfie to help verify you. In some special cases, you may be asked to upload a picture of yourself (a selfie) while holding your ID. Find out more about selfie verification.

### How long does verification take?

If we ask to verify you while setting up a transfer, we’ll start reviewing your documents once we have received the money for the transfer. From there we’ll work to get it done within 2–3 working days. When successfully verified, we’ll automatically resume your transfer, and let you know by email.
