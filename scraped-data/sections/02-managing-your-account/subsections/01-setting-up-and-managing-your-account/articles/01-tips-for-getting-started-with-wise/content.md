# Setting up and managing your account  
## Tips for getting started with Wise  
Wise is an online account that lets you send money, get paid, and spend money internationally. With a Wise account, you can send money abroad, get paid in other currencies, and spend abroad on the Wise card.

Here are some tips to help you get started.

### Get verified to open your Wise account

With a Wise account, you’ll be able to:

  * hold 50+ currencies in your account

  * convert currencies instantly in your account with low fees

  * get account details to receive money in AUD, CAD, GBP, HUF, EUR, NZD, RON, SGD, TRY and USD

  * set up Direct Debits in AUD, CAD, GBP, EUR, and USD

  * order a Wise card (currently available in Europe, US, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, and Singapore)

  * spend on the debit card in any currency with low fees

  * set aside money in any currency with Wise Jars.




To open your Wise account, you’ll need to get verified, usually with some photo ID, proof of address, and/or a picture of you holding that ID. It usually takes about 2 working days. Log in to your account and follow the steps to get set up.

### Wise is safe, secure, and regulated 

Since our first transfer, in 2011, we’ve helped millions of people send money to more than 70 countries. To do business in all of the countries we operate in, we have to be registered with numerous financial authorities, all over the world. 

We use HTTPS encryption, and 2-step verification to protect all your transactions and make sure your communications with us are secure. We’ll never misuse or sell your data. And we have real live people who watch over every transaction, and confirm every customer’s identity. 

**Tip:** **Read customer reviews on Trustpilot**

### We use the real, mid-market exchange rate 

Banks and other providers often set their own, unfriendly exchange rates. It means that you pay more than you need to, and they pocket the difference. 

At Wise, we never mark up the exchange rate. You’ll always get the real mid-market exchange rate — like you’d find on independent sources like Reuters, New Change or XE.

 **Tip:** **Compare us** ******to other providers​**
