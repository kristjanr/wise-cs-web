# Setting up and managing your account  
## What happens if I create a duplicate account?  
We’ll send an email to your registered email address if we notice this has happened — with 2 options to access your existing account: 

  1. Reset your password

  2. Change your email address




### What happens if I deactivate my existing account? 

You won’t be able to access the deactivated account. This means you won’t have access to your account’s previous history or your previous Wise account details.

 **If you’ve given us your CPF number** , you can’t deactivate the existing account to make a new one. Instead, try resetting your password or changing your email to get access to your account. 

Changed your mind? _Learn how to reactivate your old account_ — this means the duplicate account will be deactivated in exchange.

In some cases, Wise can close duplicate accounts without notifying you. You can read more in our **Terms and Conditions** under your region.
