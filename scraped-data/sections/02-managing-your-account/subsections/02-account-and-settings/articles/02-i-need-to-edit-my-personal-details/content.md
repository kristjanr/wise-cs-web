## I need to edit my personal details  
There are different ways to do this (changing address, date of birth, phone number, email), depending on which accounts you have.

Bear in mind that you might not be able to edit all your details — scroll down to see what you can and can't edit. 

### If you only have a personal account

On the web:

  1. Select your name in the top right corner

  2. Select **Your details**

  3. Select **Edit details**




In the Wise app:

  1. Click on your profile icon in the top corner

  2. Tap on **Edit** next to your full name

  3. Edit your details




### If you have a personal account and business account

You can only edit your personal details from your personal account. From our side, those changes will be carried over to your business account, too. 

Switch to your personal account on web:

  1. Select your name on the top right corner

  2. Select **Your details**

  3. Select **Edit details**




Switch to your personal account on the Wise app:

  1. Go to your **Home tab**

  2. Click on your profile icon in the top corner

  3. Choose your **Personal account**




### If you only have a business account

On the web:

  1. Select your business name in the top right corner

  2. Select **Settings**

  3. Select **Personal details**

  4. Select **Edit your details**




 **Tip:** If you can’t edit your personal details from your business account, it might be because you’ve already got a personal account — and you’ll need to edit your details from your personal account.

### What you can and can’t edit

 **Your date of birth** can’t be changed by you after you’ve completed your first transfer.

 **Your name** can be updated in certain circumstances. If you have changed your name for any reason, we can help you update the name on your account. We'll ask you to send us a photo or scan of the legal document showing your name change (like your marriage certificate, deed poll, etc.) along with your ID if it hasn’t been verified yet.

 **Your address** can usually be changed by following the steps below. Once you’ve changed your details there, we’ll be in touch if we need to _reverify your address_.

If the address field is greyed out, you can’t change it yourself. Get in touch and we’ll help change it. 

**Your phone number** can be changed, but if you have 2-step verification enabled, you’ll need to confirm your new number by text. You can't change your **backup phone number** or add a new one, but you can remove it.

Your email address can be changed on both our website and the app.
