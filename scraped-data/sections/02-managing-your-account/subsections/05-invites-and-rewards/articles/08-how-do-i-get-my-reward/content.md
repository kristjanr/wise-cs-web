# Invites and rewards  
## How do I get my reward?  
Once you’ve qualified for your reward, we’ll send you an email with info on how to claim it. 

### Can I get my invite reward in a different currency or account?

We can send the reward to most currencies Wise supports. You can see the available currencies when you claim your reward.

If you’re having trouble claiming the reward, you’ll need to:

  1. Add your bank account as a recipient

  2. Contact us — let us know the currency and last 4 digits of the bank account you’d like to receive your reward into
