# Invites and rewards  
## How do I make sure my invites count towards my reward?  
To count towards your reward, your friend needs to:

  1. Sign up with your invite link

  2. Make one international transfer (check how much they need to send to qualify on your invite page)

  3. Send the full amount in one transfer




There are a few ways your friend can use Wise which won’t count towards your reward. These include:

  * Same currency transfers (like a transfer from EUR to EUR, or topping up your GBP account with GBP)

  * Converting between their different balances

  * Using the Wise card

  * Sending a transfer that’s less than the amount you see on your invite page




### How do I know I’ve qualified for my reward?

Once you’ve qualified for the reward, we’ll send you an email with info on how you can claim it.

If you’re on an invite program that gives you fee credit as a reward, then this’ll be added to your account automatically.

You can check how many friends you have left to invite by checking your invite page.
