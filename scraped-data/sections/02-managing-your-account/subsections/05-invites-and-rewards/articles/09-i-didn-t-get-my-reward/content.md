# Invites and rewards  
## I didn't get my reward  
You’ll qualify for your reward after your last invite has made their _qualifying transfer_. And it can take up to 5 working days for the reward to be ready to claim. 

Once your reward is ready, we’ll send you an email with info on how you can claim it.

We don’t send out your reward automatically, because we don’t know which account you’d like to receive it into.

If you haven’t received an email, it could be that you haven’t qualified for your reward just yet. If you’re on an invite program that rewards you with fee credit, it’ll be added to your account automatically — you won’t need to claim it.

### What if I entered the wrong account details for the reward? 

We can't cancel the reward payment once it’s been sent out. Though, some banks might reject a payment if the details aren’t correct, and will send the money back to us.

If we get the reward back, we’ll send you an email so you can update your account details. Bear in mind that it could take a while for the bank to return the money to us — sometimes up to a few months.

 **Wise can’t get involved in disputes if you claim the reward to the wrong account.**
