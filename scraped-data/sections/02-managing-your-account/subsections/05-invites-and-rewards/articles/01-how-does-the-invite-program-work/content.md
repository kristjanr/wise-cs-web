# Invites and rewards  
## How does the invite program work?  
The more people send money with Wise, the better it is for everyone.

### Get money when you invite a friend

Every friend that you invite to Wise will get a discount on their first transfer. We’ll reward you for inviting a bunch of friends, too.

We have lots of different rewards for spreading the word about Wise. For example, with one program in the UK, you’ll get 50 GBP once 3 invited friends make a qualifying payment of at least 200 GBP each.

That’s it! Start inviting your friends now.

### How do I invite friends?

Inviting friends is easy, they just need to click on your unique invite link and join Wise. Your invite link can be found on your invite page.

Remember, for your invites to count, your friends need to sign up and make an international transfer of at least 200 GBP after using your invite link. Your friends will see a green button saying **Claim your fee-free transfer** when they go on Wise after following your link.

You may need to verify your identity before we can pay out your bonus.

### Can I choose my reward program?

When you sign up with Wise, your invite program is automatically assigned to you — it can’t be changed, either. We have many different programs to reward you for spreading the word about Wise, and we’re always testing out new ones.

### Offer details

  * You can earn the invite reward multiple times — just invite more friends.

  * To count towards your reward, each friend who signs up using your invite link has to complete a single international transfer for at least 200 GBP (or its equivalent in another supported currency) to be considered as a qualified referral.

  * Transfers without conversion don’t count towards your referral program.

  * Friends using your link to sign up will receive a discount on their first transfer fee. (The fee-free transfer credit does not cover credit card fees which may be charged by the card processor.)

  * Each invite can only qualify towards one referral program, should your referral program be changed.

  * If your friend makes a transfer for less than the qualifying amount, the transfer is still fee-free, but won’t count towards your referral reward.

  * If at any point in the future they complete a single transfer over the qualifying amount, they will be included in your list of qualified invites, counting towards your reward. Please note that the qualifying amount is not cumulative and must be made in a single transfer to count as a qualified invite. Check how much your friends need to send to qualify on your invite page.

  * The standard reward amount is 50 GBP (or equivalent), but the reward may vary in different regions, or during special promotional periods or campaigns. Different terms and conditions will be shown in the referral invitation or accompanying promotional materials. You can see what program you are enrolled in from your invite page. 

  * The reward amount will be paid out to a bank account that is held in your own name. 

  * We can send the reward to most currencies Wise supports. You can see the available currencies when you claim your reward.

  * We can currently only pay out 80 BRL as a reward in Brazil due to regulations there. If you’d prefer, you can have the bonus as fee credit added to your account.

  * We reserve the right to remove access to the referral program or to refuse a reward if we suspect violation of terms or any activity we determine as abusive (for example, by inviting yourself, fictitious people, or already existing users) or damaging of the Wise brand (for example, in connection with sexually explicit, discriminatory or illegal content).

  * We reserve the right to modify the referral offer at any time. By continuing to invite friends after an update to the terms, you are indicating that you are accepting them.

  * We sometimes conduct tests to try different invite programs, and you could be part of one. As such, we reserve the right to amend, alter, or change the referral offer at any time.
