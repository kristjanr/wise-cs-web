## How does fee credit work?  
Fee credit is a discount on the fee for your transfer. It works across multiple transfers until the amount runs out.

If you have a free transfer and fee credit at the same time, weâ€™ll use the free transfer first.

Fee credit applies to regular transfers, and paying into and withdrawing from your balances.
