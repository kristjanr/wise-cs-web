# Invites and rewards  
## How does the card invite program work?  
You can now give free cards to friends you invite to Wise. 

### **How do I invite friends?**

Inviting friends is easy — they just need to click on your unique invite link and join Wise. You can find the invite link on your _invite page_.

Remember, for your invites to count, **3 friends** need to spend a certain amount with their Wise card after using your invite link. They'll automatically receive a card after joining.

You may need to verify your identity before we can pay out your bonus.

###  **How to qualify for the reward?**

Each friend who signs up using your invite link has to spend at least 100 GBP (or equivalent in another supported currency) to be considered as a qualified referral. The transactions can be in any currency.

We'll add your friend to the list of qualifying invites, once they've spent the qualifying amount. They'll still get the card for free, even if they spend less. 

Check how much your friends need to spend to qualify on your _invite page_.

Once you’ve qualified for the reward, we’ll send you an email explaining how you can claim it.

Each invite can only qualify towards the referral program that was live when you sent it.

The standard reward amount is 75 GBP (or equivalent). The reward may vary in different regions, or during special promotional periods or campaigns. The specific terms and conditions will be shown in the referral invitation or accompanying promotional materials. 

You can see what program you're enrolled in from your _invite page_.
