# Invites and rewards  
## What's the Wise affiliate program?  
Our affiliate program gives you the opportunity to spread the word about Wise and our mission — and earn a commission for each new user you send our way. If you’re an affiliate partner, we’ll give you a unique affiliate link that you can use on your website, emails, blog posts, and social media. When a user signs up with us through your link, you get rewarded.
