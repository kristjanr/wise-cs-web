# Using Assets  
## Managing your Balance or Jar when it's held as Interest  
Switching to Interest doesn’t change what you can do with your money. 

Whenever you add or receive money, we’ll buy units in the fund we’ve chosen that are worth the same cash value. When you send or spend money (including using your Wise card), we’ll sell units worth the same cash value.

###  **If your address is in the UK or in the European Economic Area***

If you choose to hold your money as Interest, we’ll invest it in the following Money Market Funds depending on the currency you select:


--- CSV table begins ---  
Asset,Fund  
Interest-earning fund (GBP),BlackRock ICS Sterling Government Liquidity Fund Premier Acc (GBP) Managed by BlackRock.  
Interest-earning fund (EUR),BlackRock ICS Euro Government Liquidity Fund Premier Acc T0 (EUR) Managed by BlackRock  
Interest-earning fund (USD),BlackRock ICS US Treasury Fund Premier ACC (USD) Managed by BlackRock  
--- CSV table ends ---  


Your money will be held in a fund that invests in short-terms loans backed by governments. When these loans are repaid with interest, the fund’s value grows. 

We only buy or sell units once per day. We handle the investment transactions behind the scenes — by buying or selling units in the fund at the available next trading cut-off time — which is 7:00 AM GMT. 

It can take up to 2 working days to complete buy and sell orders for your units.
