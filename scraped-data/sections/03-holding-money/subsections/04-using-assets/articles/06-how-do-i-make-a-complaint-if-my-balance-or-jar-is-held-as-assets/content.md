# Using Assets  
## How do I make a complaint if my Balance or Jar is held as Assets?  
We are sorry you didn't get the service you'd expect from Wise.

If your complaint is related to a Balance or Jar held as Assets, get in touch with us by _sending us an email_. 

In this message, include:

  * your Wise membership number (beginning with P)

  * what your complaint is about

  * what you’d like us to do to fix it.




We’ll investigate your case referring to our Terms and Conditions and send you a final response within **14 calendar days.**

If you’re unhappy with our decision, you can escalate it to the relevant dispute body.

 **The dispute body and Terms and Conditions are based on the address you had on your Wise account at the time you switched a currency account or Jar to Stocks, not your current residential address.**

For example, if you’re currently in the EU but your complaint is about a balance that was switched to stocks when you were in the UK, then you should refer to the UK Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS).

 **If the address was in the UK,** you can make a complaint to the FOS.
