# Using Assets  
## Who can use Assets?  
We’d like to offer Assets to everyone but right now it is only available to residents of the following regions: 

### **UK**

Assets is available to **consumers** and **businesses** that are residents in the UK. British overseas territories are not yet included.

We can’t onboard every type of business — if you don’t see the option to switch a Jar or Balances to Assets, that means we can’t onboard your business. We’ll let you know when that changes.

If your address is in the UK you can switch your **Balances** and **Jars** to:

### **What happens if I hold my money in Assets and I move countries?**

Your money will remain invested, but keep in mind:

  * You can keep the Balances and Jars you already have invested in Assets. You won’t be able to add more money to these and you won’t be able to switch other Balances and Jars to Assets, until you move back to a country where Assets is available.

  * If you decide to switch your Balance or Jar back to Cash, you won’t be able to reinvest it until you move back to a country where Assets is available. 




**Two exceptions are the US and Brazil. If your new address is in one of these countries we’ll switch your invested Balances and Jars back to Cash (which means we’ll sell all your units) as soon as the address has been updated.**

###  **Can I use Assets if I’m a US citizen/tax payer?**

Not yet. Because of how our fund partner is regulated we can’t onboard US citizens/tax payers. You can’t switch your Balances and Jars to Assets if you have US dual citizenship either. 

You might be still eligible to earn interest on your money if you live in the US.
