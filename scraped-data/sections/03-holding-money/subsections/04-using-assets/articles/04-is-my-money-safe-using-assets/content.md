**What happens if Wise becomes insolvent?**

Wise Assets (offered by TINV Europe AS, an investment subsidiary of Wise) holds customers’ fund units segregated from any corporate assets. In the unlikely event of Wise (or TINV Europe AS) becoming insolvent, your assets are held separately from any of Wise’s other corporate assets. Insolvency practitioners would not be permitted to use any of these assets to cover outstanding debts. 

Internally, we keep detailed records of all our customers’ investments. This information is reviewed and reconciled each business day. If Wise (or TINV Europe AS) becomes insolvent, we would have clear records that show the amount of assets that belong to each customer. This would enable the insolvency practitioner to identify all assets that belong to you and make sure your assets are returned to you or transferred to a different provider. 

All of the processes described above are in line with the Estonian regulations applicable to regulated investment service providers. We are also subject to an annual external audit, an external inspection to assess if we operate in line with the relevant regulations. We have nominated PwC to perform this annual audit. 

All of this means that your investment will be returned to you in the event of Wise (or TINV Europe AS) going bankrupt. In addition to the protection offered through the strict segregation of our customers’ assets, the Estonian Investor Protection Sectoral Fund will cover your assets for up to € 20 000. 

**What happens if our fund provider (BlackRock) becomes insolvent?**

BlackRock, a global and reputable investment company, is the fund manager of the funds we offer. In the unlikely event of BlackRock going bankrupt, it is important to know that the underlying assets (for example, for the equity fund this would be the shares of the companies that make up the index) are not held by BlackRock itself. Instead, a third party (known as the depositary or trustee) would look after the underlying assets of the fund. This means that the underlying assets are protected from creditors in the event of the fund manager becoming insolvent.

**What happens if Wise Assets becomes insolvent?**

Wise Assets (trading name of TINV Ltd, an investment subsidiary of Wise) holds customers’ fund units segregated from any corporate assets, registered in the name of a separate legal entity (TINV Nominees Ltd).

Insolvency practitioners would not be permitted to use any of these assets to cover outstanding debts. This is because TINV Nominees Ltd. is a separate legal entity that would not be drawn into the insolvency. It simply exists to hold segregated assets on behalf of Wise Assets' customers.

In addition to the protection offered through the strict segregation of our customers’ assets, the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (“FSCS”) protects each customer for up to £85,000. The FSCS could step in if Wise Assets goes bust and there’s a shortfall in the assets we hold for you.
