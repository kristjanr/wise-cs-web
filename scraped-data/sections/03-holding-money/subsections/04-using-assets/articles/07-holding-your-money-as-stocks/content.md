# Using Assets  
## Holding your money as Stocks  
With Assets, you can decide how you'd like to hold the money in your Balances or Jars.

Currently, you can choose Cash, Interest or Stocks. 

If you choose to hold your money as Stocks, we’ll invest all of the Balance or Jar in a fund we’ve chosen.

 **Invest in hundreds of the world’s biggest companies**

When you choose to hold your money as Stocks, we’ll invest it in an index tracking fund we’ve chosen — the iShares World Equity Index Fund, managed by BlackRock. It tracks the MSCI World Index. 

The MSCI World Index is a portfolio of stocks that represent the economy in developed countries. It includes some of the world’s biggest companies — like Apple, Tesla, and Microsoft. 

Your money is at risk whenever you invest, but in funds like this, that risk is spread. So if one company doesn’t do so well, your total investment might be less affected.

 **Pay low fees**

You pay two fees when you invest using your Wise account — a service fee to Wise and a fund fee to BlackRock, the fund manager. 

The service fee is 0.40% annually. The fund fee is 0.15% annually. Both fees are taken automatically.
