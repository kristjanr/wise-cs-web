# Using Assets  
## Understanding how your money is performing when you hold it as Stocks  
###  **Checking the performance of your investment using the app**

The fastest way to check your Assets performance is via the app.

  1. Log into your Wise account in the app 

  2. Go to your currency account or jar held as Stocks

  3. Click on the Stocks icon




On the following pages you will see:

 _ **Your gains graph:**_ it reflects two types of gains — “realised” and “unrealised” gains. Learn more about them below. 

_**Fund performance graph:**_ The relative performance of the fund in percentage across the period of time selected.

You can easily toggle between different time periods below the graph to see the data most relevant to you. 

#### **What are gains?**

The gains value shows the difference in value of the stocks when you switched your account or jar from Cash to Stocks, compared to the selected date. It helps you understand how the value of the stock has changed over time.

To understand the gains graph fully, it’s good to know that it reflects two types of gains — “realised” and “unrealised” gains. 

**Realised gains** are calculated from the units you have sold to send money, withdraw or spend from Stocks. For each of these transactions Wise sells some units to cover the respective amounts. If the fund performance has increased, then fewer units would need to be sold. If the fund performance has decreased, then more units would need to be sold. In both cases, this difference is the realised gains. The accumulation of these differences from the day you started investing to a given date, is the realised gains up to that date.

 **Unrealised gains** are calculated from the units you have remaining as Stocks. In other words, anything you haven’t withdrawn, sent or spent yet. It looks at the difference between the price of the units on a particular day and the prices of those units on the day they were purchased. Again, unrealised gains can be positive or negative.

###  **Checking the performance of your investment using the Standard and Accounting statement**

These reports can be found by the **...** or **More …** on currency account or jar page, and selecting the option of **Statements**.

In both statements there will be a line above the last transaction called **Earnings since start**.

 **Earnings since start** lets you know the difference between holding money as Stocks versus Cash since the day you started investing in this currency account or jar. 

This is done by comparing the value of your currency account or jar by using the fund price on the last day on the statement against a summation of all the historical cash transactions, which effectively produces the balance your currency account or jar would have had if it were always held as cash.

If the price of the fund unit dropped since you invested your currency account or jar, you may see a negative amount as **Earning since start**. 

### **How can I access my earnings?**

We offer an _Accumulating fund class_ – so any income from the underlying assets (e.g. cash dividends from a company in the fund) are reinvested by the fund manager back into the fund. When you withdraw or spend money from this Balance or Jar, or when you convert it back to Cash, your earnings will be realised.

If you buy units and their price goes up, your investment has grown. This means that a unit is worth more compared to when you bought it. It also means that you spend less units if you choose to sell at that price.

When you spend or send from your account, we sell the equivalent number of units. So, to access your earnings, you just need to spend your money. There’s no need to divest the balance or Jar held as Stocks.

###  **How to read the fund performance graph for Stocks?**

This performance graph tracks the relative change in the fund day after day. Our **Stocks** fund tracks the MSCI world index, so the changes you see here reflect the same relative changes to that index. 

_Learn more about the fund and MSCI world index_.

The past performance and future projections of the fund may show an upward trend.* However, the performance of a Balance or Jar held as Stocks will not always match the fund performance due to some factors that impact the investment, such as:

  * Moving money to and from the Balance or Jar held as Stocks

  * The price of the unit when you buy or sell your investment or part of it. 




The exchange rate may also affect the performance of balances and Jars held in different currencies (ie not in EUR). 

_Learn how conversion impacts your investment._

 _*_ Please bear in mind that past performance and projections don’t guarantee future growth.
