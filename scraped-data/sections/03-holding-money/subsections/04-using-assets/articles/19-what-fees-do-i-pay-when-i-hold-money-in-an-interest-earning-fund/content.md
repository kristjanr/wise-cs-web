## What fees do I pay when I hold money in an interest-earning fund?  
When you **hold your money in an interest-earning fund** you pay two fees: a service fee and a fund fee. 

### **What’s the service fee?**

The service fee is charged by Wise. We calculate it daily, based on the amount you hold as Stocks or Interest in your Balances and Jars — and we charge it on the 1st day of the following month.

We’ll always take the service fee from a Balance — we don’t charge the fee to _Jars_. We’ll charge the fee to your Balance that’s in the same currency. This balance can be held as Cash or Interest. 

If you don’t have enough money in that Balance to pay the fee, we’ll take it from another one that does have money in it.

 **What’s the fund management fee?**

The fund management fee is charged by the fund manager. It’s automatically reflected in the value of your investment, so you won’t see it charged to your account as a separate fee.
