# Holding money basics  
## How does Wise hold my money?  
Wise is a _non-bank payment provider_. This means your Wise account is an electronic money account. 

This makes your Wise account different from a bank account. Some of the differences are:

  * Your money is _safeguarded_ and not covered by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS), or another protection scheme that you would get with a bank account

  * You can’t get an overdraft or loan 

  * You won’t earn interest




The main benefit to having a Wise account, over a traditional bank account, is being able to manage your money without borders — without international transaction fees or outrageous exchange rates. You’ll always get the real exchange rate and low fees with Wise.
