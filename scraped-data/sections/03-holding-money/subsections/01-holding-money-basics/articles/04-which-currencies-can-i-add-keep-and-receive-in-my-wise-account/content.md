*You need to be a Brazilian tax resident to add money in BRL. 

**IDR can be used to top up any balance except IDR.

***Only Malaysian residents can top up their MYR balance directly by MYR.

You can keep 50+ currencies in your account. You can convert money between any of these currencies in your account, always with the real exchange rate.

And you can receive money from other people in these currencies using account details:

  * AUD from any bank account in Australia

  * EUR from any bank account in the world that’s denominated in EUR

  * GBP from any bank account in the UK, or by SWIFT

  * NZD from any bank account in New Zealand

  * MYR from any bank account in Malaysia (only available if you're a resident in Malaysia and only supported for personal accounts)

  * SGD from any bank account in Singapore

  * USD from any bank account in the US, or by SWIFT from certain countries

  * RON from any bank account in Romania (only available if you’re a resident in the EEA, Switzerland, the US, Canada, Australia, or Japan)
