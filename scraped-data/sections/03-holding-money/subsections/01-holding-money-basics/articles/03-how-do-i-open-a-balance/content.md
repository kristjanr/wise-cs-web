# Holding money basics  
## How do I open a balance?  
To open a balance, you’ll need to:

  1. Go to **Home** on the website or app.

  2. Choose which currencies you’d like to hold money in by clicking **Open a balance**.

  3. You’ll need to add some money and verify your identity first to keep your account safe.




Once you’re all set up, you’re ready to:

  * Add money to your balances whenever you like. Just choose which currency you’d like to add to, then click Add money. When you add money to your account, make sure it comes from your own bank account. If you want to add money to your business account, make sure the money comes from your company’s bank account. 

  * Receive money with your local account details. 

  * Convert money between your currencies in seconds whenever you need at the real exchange rate with a low conversion fee.

  * Send money directly from any currency in your account to pay bills, send money to friends and family, and more.

  * Spend money with your Wise card.

  * Set money aside in a jar.




Remember that your personal Wise account is meant for personal use only. If you’d like to send and receive payments as a business, please register your business with us first and then open your business balances.
