# Holding money basics  
## What are Jars and how do I use them?  
Money in a Jar is kept separately from your balances. You can’t accidentally spend it with your debit card, and you can’t send it or use it to pay Direct Debits.

You can open as many Jars as you need to organise your money.

Use Jars for:

  * saving up for a holiday or big purchase

  * storing money you want to send in another currency

  * planning for bills or other future expenses

  * setting aside money for a rainy day




### How do I use Jars?

When you open a Jar, you’ll choose the currency you want to save in and give it a name and emoji. Then you can add money from any of your balances.

When you’re ready to spend, you’ll need to withdraw money to a balance that’s in the same currency as the Jar.
