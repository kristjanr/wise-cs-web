###  **I was charged a EUR holding fee in August 2022**

From December 2020 to August 2022, we charged a fee for holding large amounts of EUR. This was introduced because of negative interest rates in the Eurozone. In August 2022, we completely removed this charge.

If you were charged on the 1st of August, this was to cover the holding fee for the previous month. The fee was calculated based on the amount of EUR you held over the free allowance in July. The thresholds were:

  * up to 3,000 EUR for free for personal customers.

  * up to 30,000 EUR for free for business customers.




Anything above the free allowance had a 0.9% annual fee charged on a monthly basis. You can check the table below to see the old fees:
