## Can I request a refund for my Direct Debit?  
### Requesting a refund for my GBP or AUD Direct Debit payment

If something went wrong with either the goods or services you paid for or the agreement you made with your merchant — you’ll need to contact the merchant directly to resolve the issue. We aren’t able to help negotiate with them in these situations.

If there was a technical error with the transaction, you can request a refund. Some examples would be:

  * you were charged double

  * you were charged after you had cancelled the Direct Debit

  * you never set up a payment to this merchant
