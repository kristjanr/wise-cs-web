# Adding money to your balances  
## How do I add money to a balance?  
There are a couple of different ways you can add money to your Wise balances.

### Add money through Wise

One way to add money to your balance is through your Wise account:

  1. Go to the balance you’d like to add money to.

  2. Click **Add.**

  3. Choose how much you want to add and the currency you’d like to pay with.

  4. Select how you’d like to pay, and click **Continue** to payment.

  5. Depending on how you’d like to pay, you’ll be guided through the payment steps.




If you’re using this method to add money, the money has to come from a bank account that matches the name on your Wise account. So, if you have a Wise account for your business, the bank account you add money from has to be under the business name. 

You can’t add money in any of these currencies: AED, BDT, CLP, CRC, EGP, HKD, GEL, IDR, ILS, INR, KES, MXN, LKR, NGN, NPR, MAD, PEN, PHP, PKR, RUB, THB, UAH, VND, ZAR, and CNY. If you want to hold them, add money from your bank account in one of the available currencies and then convert to these currencies. 

### Add money from your bank account

You can also add money to your balance is via a direct deposit/ bank transfer. You can only do this if your currency account has account details. This way, you don't need to set up a top-up in your Wise account first.

Just log in to your online banking, set up a normal transfer and add the details that you can find in your Wise account. To reveal the account details of your balance, click on the balance you’d like to send to.

You’ll also have to make sure you send the same currency as your balance is in. So, if you’re adding to your GBP account this way, you’ll need to send money in GBP.
